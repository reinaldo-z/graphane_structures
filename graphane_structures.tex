We present a theoretical study of spin and current injection, and second-
harmonic generation via optical means from the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up graphene structures. The incidence of circularly polarized
light onto nonmagnetic semiconductors produces spin-polarized electrons in the
conduction bands. Current injection and second-harmonic generation are
nonlinear, second-order effects that can be produced from both the bulk and
surface of non-centrosymmetric materials. In centrosymmetric materials, these
effects can only be observed at the surface where the inversion symmetry is
broken.} {We also report results for the degree of spin polarization, current
injection, and second-harmonic generation calculated within a full electronic
band structure scheme at the DFT-LDA level using a planewave basis. Our
results show that these effects can be optically generated in both the
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures, presenting an
anisotropic behavior. We obtain a maximum degree of spin polarization of 39\%
for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt, and 57\% for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up, which are
promising results for potential applications in spintronics.}}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Graphene is an allotrope of carbon with a planar, hexagonal, two-dimensional
honeycomb structure with one carbon atom at each vertex \cite{geim2007rise}.
Graphene has attracted great interest due to its distinctive physical
properties, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, optical absorption,
thermal conductivity, and band structure \cite{geim2007rise,nair2008fine}.
Graphene can be produced via several techniques, the most common of these is
graphite exfoliation for producing small graphene sheets. Larger graphene
films on the order of centimeters obtained by chemical vapor deposition on
copper substrates using methane.

Graphene has been characterized with a variety of microscopic and mechanical
techniques such as atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
scanning tunneling microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy
\cite{geim2007rise,rao2009graphene,boehm1994nomenclature,novoselov2005two}.
Graphene behaves like a metal \cite{geim2007rise} but its band gap can be
tuned by changing the total area \cite{han2007energy}, applying an electric
field \cite{zhang2009direct}, or by doping \cite{ohta2006controlling,%
elias2009control,guisinger2009exposure,samarakoon2010tunable}. This paper
presents a study on two hydrogenated graphene structures. We can obtain
different spatial configurations by varying the amount and location of the
hydrogen doping. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}, when a H atom is
bonded to a carbon atom in the graphene plane, it pulls the carbon atom from
the plane modifying the carbon-carbon bond length, and possibly opening the
band gap \cite{samarakoon2010tunable}. The C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up systems presented in this paper both have 50\%
hydrogenation and present a band gap.

We focus on three phenomena used for characterizing semiconducting systems:
the optical spin injection, optical current injection, and second-harmonic
generation (SHG). The optical spin injection is characterized by the
adimensional degree of spin polarization (DSP), which is a function of
frequency. The DSP is the fraction of injected electrons in the conduction
bands that are spin polarized versus those that are not. There are theoretical
reports of DSP calculations for bulk media (Si, GaAs, CdSe, and Ge
semiconductors) \cite{nastos2007full,cabellos2009stress,rioux2010optical} and
surfaces [Si(111):In, Si(111):As, GaAs(110):Sb, GaAs(110), and Si(111) with
$4\times2$ and $8\times2$ reconstructions]
\cite{mendoza2012optical,arzate2014optical}.

%% need intro paragraph for OCI.

Nonlinear optical spectroscopies, particularly SHG, are important methods for
styudying surface properties due to their noninvasive and nondestructive
nature. These properties include atomic structure, phase transitions,
adsorption of atoms, and many others \cite{dadap1997second,%
daum1993identification,mcgilp1994probing,power1995resonant,%
godefroy1996electric,salazar2014molecular,chen1981surface,%
mendoza1998microscopic}. For SHG calculation we followed
the new formalism developed in Ref. \cite{anderson2015theory} for SHG from
semiconductor surfaces.

The organization of the sections of this paper is as follows. In Sec.
\ref{sec:theory} we present the theory and formulas that describe the DSP,
current injection, and SHG. In Sec. \ref{sec:results} we describe the details
of the calculation and the corresponding spectra for the respective \emph{alt}
and \emph{up} structures. Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec.
\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\subsection{Optical spin injection}

The injection and detection of spin polarized electrons into nonmagnetic
materials is the core of spintronics \cite{vzutic2004spintronics,%
fert2008nobel,pezzoli2012optical,bottegoni2013experimental,%
bottegoni2013photoinduced} and an important problem in condensed matter
theory. The process of optical spin injection appears when circularly
polarized light (CPL) \cite{dyakonov1984theory} is incident on a
semiconducting material. This allows spin polarized electrons to move from the
valence to the conduction bands. This process is the result of the interaction
between the electron spin and the motion caused by the spin-orbit coupling in
the material. The DSP is the percentage of injected spin polarized electrons
in the conduction bands. It can be calculated with full band structure local-
density approximation (LDA), and $\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ methods
\cite{nastos2007full,cabellos2009stress}.

The complete expressions for the DSP are derived in reference
\cite{mendoza2012optical} for surfaces and interfaces, and we summarize them
briefly here. We assume an incoming beam of CPL at normal incidence that
propogates along the $-z$ direction, $\mathbf{E}(\omega) = E_{0}(\hat{x} -
i\hat{y})/\sqrt{2}$. The degree of spin polarization for this beam is
expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:D^i}
D^{a}(\omega) = 
\frac{-4i\zeta^{axy}(\omega)}
    {\hbar\left[\xi^{xx}(\omega) + \xi^{yy}(\omega)\right]},
\end{equation}
where $\zeta^{axy} (\omega)$ and $\xi^{aa}(\omega)$ are the 
\begin{changed}
surface spin injection rate tensor components and the diagonal components of
the surface carrier generation rate tensor, respectively.
\end{changed} 
and the $abc$ superscripts denote the Cartesian coordinates. The spin
injection tensor is

\begin{align}\label{eq:zeta}
\zeta^{abc} &= \frac{i\pi e^{2}}{\hbar^{2}}\int\frac{d^{3}k}{8\pi^{3}}
\sum_{vcc'}^{\prime}\text{Im}\bigl[\mathcal{S}^{i}_{c'c}(\textbf{k})
r^{j}_{vc'}(\textbf{k})r^{k}_{cv}(\textbf{k})\nonumber\\
&\qquad+\mathcal{S}^{i}_{cc'}(\textbf{k})
r^{j}_{vc}(\textbf{k})r^{k}_{c'v}(\textbf{k})\bigr]
\delta(\omega_{cv}(\textbf{k})-\omega),
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{S}$ and $r$ are the spin and position matrix elements. The
expression of Eq. \eqref{eq:zeta} satisfies the $\zeta^{abc}(\omega) =
-\zeta^{acb}(\omega)$ condition.

% \begin{equation*}
% \mathbf{E}(\omega) = E_{0}(\hat{x} - i\hat{y})/\sqrt{2}, 
% \end{equation*}
% where $E_{0}$ is the incoming field intensity. Finally, we write the surface
% DSP in the \emph{i} direction as

\begin{changed}
\begin{equation*}
\dot{S}^{i}(\omega) = \zeta^{abc}(\omega)E^{j}(-\omega)E^{k}(\omega),
\end{equation*}
\end{changed}


It is generally possible to generate spin-polarized electrons along all three
$\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ directions. The total DSP can be obtained
as

\begin{equation*}
\left|D^{\text{T}}\right| = \sqrt{D_{x}^{2} + D_{y}^{2} + D_{z}^{2}}.
\end{equation*}


\begin{changed}
\subsection{Optical current injection}

The optical current injection (OCI) is a second-order nonlinear effect that takes place in non-centrosymmetric materials \cite{nastos2006optical,cabellos2011optical,bhat2005excitonic,fraser1999quantum}. The current can be produced with a single optical beam of CPL via the interference of one photon-absorption processes from different linear polarizations of light \cite{sipe2000second}.

This photocurrent effect has been studied in bulk semiconductors, one dimensional (1D) nanotubes \cite{mele2000coherent,kral2000photogalvanic}, and two dimensional (2D) surfaces \cite{mele2000coherent}.

The one-photon current injection is characterized by the current injection tensor, $\eta(0;\omega,-\omega)$ which is a particular case of $\eta(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2};\omega_{1},-\omega_{2})$, where $\omega{1}$ and $\omega{2}$ are the frequencies of the two incoming beams. The frequency dependence of the injection current tensor is expressed as $\eta(\omega)$ instead of $\eta(0;\omega,-\omega)$.

Starting from the current density operator (ref. \cite{cabellos2011optical}, eq. 3)

\begin{equation}
    \hat{j}^{i} = \sum_{mn\textbf{k}} j^{i}_{nm}(\textbf{r};\textbf{k}) \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{n\textbf{k}} \hat{c}_{n\textbf{k}},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{n\textbf{k}} $ ($\hat{c}_{n\textbf{k}} $) creates (annihilates) an electron in a Bloch state $\vert n\textbf{k} \rangle $ and $j^{i}_{nm}(\textbf{r};\textbf{k}) $ are the matrix elements of the current operator they derived the expression for the generation of injection current for surfaces
and interfaces. The surface injection current was defined as

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\dot{J}}^{i}_{\text{inj}}(\omega) =
    \eta^{abc}(\omega)E_{j}(\omega)E_{k}(\omega), \label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}
where $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is the surface injection current tensor. Thus, according to Eq. \ref{eq:eta}, a photocurrent is optically injected in the \emph{i} direction when two polarized electric fields, in the \emph{j} and \emph{k} directions, inside over a surface. For a surface system we have that {$\eta^{ixy}$} is given by \cite{cabellos2011optical,arzate2014optical}

\begin{equation}
    \eta^{abc} (\omega) = \ell_{\text{eff}} \times \sum_{\ell=1}^{n_{eff}}
    \eta_{abc} (\ell|\omega). \label{eq:etaeff}
\end{equation}
where the sum is made over the number of layers that contributes to the response of the media, $\eta_{abc} (\ell|\omega)$ corresponds to the $\ell_{\text{th}}$-layer contribution to the surface injection current tensor and $\ell_{\text{eff}}$ is the thickness to the total layers that contribute to the response. The tensor $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is purely imaginary and has the property of being antisymmetric in the last two Cartesian indices, \emph{j} and \emph{k} \cite{sipe2000second,nastos2006optical}.

Taking in account that with CPL is possible to generate current injection along the $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ directions with incident light on the surface plane, the total injection current can be obtained in a similar way as has been done in Eq. \ref{eq:D^i}

\begin{equation}
    \left|{\eta^{\text{T}}}\right| = \sqrt{ \eta_{xxy}^{2} +
    \eta_{yxy}^{2} + \eta_{zxy}^{2} },
\end{equation}
where the dependence in frequency, $\omega$, has been omitted again.

The units of both $\mathbf{\dot{J}}^{i}_{\text{inj}}(\omega)$ and $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ are those of their bulk equivalents times $\ell_{\text{eff}}$ expressed in the corresponding units to report \cite{cabellos2011optical}.
\end{changed}


\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}

SHG is a particular case of the nonlinear optical process of sum of frequency in which photons of same frequency are annihilated to produce a new photon with twice the frequency and energy and half of the wavelength of the initial photons. This phenomena occurs when light beams from coherent sources inside over a nonlinear media that does not present inversion of symmetry \cite{bloembergen1962light,anderson2015theory,sipe2000second}.

Recently, in reference \cite{anderson2015theory} was developed a new formalism to calculate the second order susceptibility which includes the scissors correction, needed to have the correct value of the energy band gap; the contribution of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, frequently used in \emph{ab initio} band-structure calculations; and the derivation for the inclusion of the cut function, used to extract the surface response. According to that we have the expressions for the imaginary part of the interband contributions (\emph{i}) and intraband (\emph{e}) for $1\omega$ and $2\omega$

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:chis}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,\omega}]= 
\frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}
\int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
\sum_{vc}\sum_{q\neq(v,c)}\frac{1}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
\left[
\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{qc}\{r^{\mathrm{b}}_
{cv}r^{\mathrm{c}}_{vq}\}]} {(2\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega^\Sigma_{cq})} 
-\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vq}\{r^{\mathrm{c}}
_{qc}r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}\}]} {(2\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega^\Sigma_{qv})}
\right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
\end{equation}  
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{i,\omega}]= 
\frac{\pi\vert e\vert^3}{2\hbar^2}
\int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
\sum_{cv}\frac{1}{(\omega^\Sigma_{cv})^{2}}
\left[
\mathrm{Re}\left[\left\{r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}\left(\mathcal{V}^
{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\right)_{;k^{\mathrm{c}}}\right\}\right]
+\frac{\mathrm{Re}\left[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\left\{
r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}
\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}_{cv}\right\}\right]}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}} 
\right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,2\omega}]= 
-\frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}
\int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
\sum_{vc}\frac{4}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
\left[
\sum_{v'\ne
  v}\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\{r^{\mathrm{
b}}_{cv'}r^{\mathrm{c}}_{v'v}\}]}
{2\omega^\Sigma_{cv'}-\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
- \sum_{c'\ne c}\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\{r^
{\mathrm{c}}_{cc'}r^{\mathrm{b}}_{c'v}\}]}
{2\omega^\Sigma_{c'v}-\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
\right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-2\omega),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{i,2\omega}]= 
 \frac{\pi \vert
   e\vert^{3}}{2\hbar^2}
\int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
\sum_{vc}\frac{4}{(\omega^\Sigma_{cv})^{2}}
\left[\mathrm{Re}\left[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\left\{
\left(r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}\right)_{;k^{\mathrm{c}}}
\right\}\right] -
\frac{2\mathrm{Re}\left[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\left\{
r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}
\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}_{cv}\right\}\right]}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}\right]
\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-2\omega)
.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Here, the factor of 2 for spin degeneracy is not included and the real part of each contribution can be obtained through a Kramers-Kronig transformation \cite{tancogne2014effect} and

\begin{equation}\label{eq:chitotal}
    \chi^{abc} = \chi^{abc}_{e,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{e,2\omega} +
    \chi^{abc}_{i,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{i,2\omega}
    .
\end{equation}

As made before, in Eq. \ref{eq:chis} and \ref{eq:chitotal} the dependence in frequency, $\omega$, has been omitted. For our case in Eq. \ref{eq:chis}, the expression $\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma}$ corresponds to the sum of the LDA and non-local velocity matrix elements, $r^{\mathrm{a}} $ are the position matrix elements and $\Delta^{a}_{nm} = v^{\text{LDA},a}_{nn} - v^{\text{LDA},a}_{mm} $. To accomplish the required intrinsic permutation symmetry, the \{\} notation symmetrizes the $bc$ Cartesian indices, i.e., $\{u^{b}s^{c}\} = (u^{b}s^{c} + u^{c}s^{b})/{2}$ and so, $\chi^{abc} = \chi^{acb}$. The units of $\chi^{abc} $, again, are those of their bulk equivalents times $\ell_{\text{eff}}$ expressed in the corresponding units to report. For full details read the appendix of Ref. \cite{anderson2015theory}.


\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\begin{changed}
The calculations of them are given in the independent-particle approximation.
\end{changed}

We present the results of the numerical calculations for {$D^{i}$}, {$\eta^{ixy}$}, and SHG for
the hydrogenated graphene structures, C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:structures}. Both systems are infinite carbon planes in an
hexagonal honeycomb lattice with 50\% of hydrogenation in two different
arrangements as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}: the \emph{alt} arrangement has
alternating hydrogen bonds in the top and bottom sides of the carbon plane; the
\emph{up} arrangement has hydrogen bonds only in the top
side. Both structures are non-centrosymmetric and has a thickness of 5.56 and
2.76 Angstroms, respectively. A vacuum length at least  five times the
thickness of each case was taken to construct the super-cell.


In this work we used the ABINIT code \cite{torrent2008implementation} for the
calculation of the self-consistent ground state and their Kohn-Sham states
using DFT-LDA in the plane waves approximation. Also, to compute the DSP
and the OCI we used the relativistic separable dual-space Gaussian
pseudopotentials of Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH)
\cite{hartwigsen1998relativistic} including the spin-orbit interaction,
necessary to make the calculations of $D^{i} $ but not in the cases of {$\eta^{ixy}$}.
For the caso of SHG we used Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials
\cite{troullier1991efficient} that are fully separable nonlocal
pseudopotentials in the Kleiman-Bylander form \cite{kleinman1982efficacious}.
The contribution of the non-local potential in Eq. \ref{eq:chis} is carried out
using the DP code \cite{olevanoDP}. Moreover, we have taken a cutoff energy of
65 and 40\,Ha for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively, and
the energy eigenvalues and matrix elements were calculated using 14452 and 8452
\textbf{k}\,points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ).

    \omega) $ tensor.\label{fig:shg-abs-both}}
\end{figure}



In Fig. \ref{fig:Da} we show the spectra obtained for
{$D^{i}$} of the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures. Values over
(under) zero define a positive (negative) direction of spin polarization along
the \emph{i} direction. 
For both structures the gap starts absorbing energy till the energy of the incoming light beam is major to it. For the \emph{alt} system it occurs near to 0.7185\,eV and for the \emph{up} one occurs near to 0.078\,eV of energy. 
It can be observed that for both structures we have
more than 30\% of {$D^{i}$} and a maximum absolute value in the \emph{y} direction,
reaching near to 60\% for the \emph{alt} case. 
Also it is important to mention that for both cases we have a range of energy in which is possible to hold the maximum DSP. 
The \emph{alt} structure presents a wide range of energy in which it is possible to have a 39\% of $D^{y}$.  It occurs from  0.7185 to 0.72\,eV of energy and a similar behavior is shown for the  $D^{x}$ and $D^{z}$ components for leaser values of DSP. After the energy of 0.72\,eV the DSP decays for the three components. 
The \emph{up} system presents a similar behavior from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV presenting a minimal variation in the $D^{y}$ component. Again, the $D^{x}$ and $D^{z}$ components have their own maximum values for this range of energy and after 0.081\,eV the DSP decays smoothly to zero.
In table \ref{tab:dacomp}
we show a comparison of the maximum degree of spin polarization reported for
different structures.

To report the {$\eta^{ixy}$} we took in account that our structures are infinite 
carbon-hydrogen layers. So in Eq. \ref{eq:etaeff} we defined the 
$\ell_{\text{eff}}$
as the thickness of each structure, corresponding to 5.56 and 2.76 Angstroms for 
the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. We show in Fig. \ref{fig:eta}
the spectra obtained for the current tensor {$\eta^{ixy}$} of the
\emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems, respectively. Again as in the case of DSP the gap starts absorbing the energy of the incident beam. We can observe that
circularly polarized light (CPL) on the plane $xy$ produces injection current
along three directions. Values over (under) zero define a positive (negative)
direction of current injection along the \emph{i} direction. From Fig.
\ref{fig:eta} we can see that for the \emph{alt} system spectra 
we have a positive maximum in the \emph{y} direction for an
incident beam energy of 1.25\,eV, reaching a value of
3.7\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. Also, for the \emph{up} spectra 
we have a positive maximum in the \emph{y} direction for an
incident beam energy of 0.09\,eV, reaching a value of
28\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. After 1.55 and 0.125\,eV of the incident field the photocurrent for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems, respectively, smoothly decreases and later the response vanishes. In table \ref{tab:etacomp} we present a comparison
of the maximum current injection reported for different structures.

In Fig. \ref{fig:shg-abs-both}  we show the absolute value of the  spectra obtained
for the SHG of the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems when we evaluated the $
\chi^{abc}(2\omega;\omega\omega) $ tensor. We can see
that for the \emph{alt} structure an absolute
maximum of the SHG spectra is reached at 0.4\,eV with a value of
0.6$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V for the $\chi^{yxx} $ component produced
principally for contributions of the imaginary part. Also, a second local
maximum is reached at 1.1\,eV with a value of 0.55$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V
for the $\chi^{xxx} $ component having in this case a principal contribution
from the real part. In the other hand, we can see that for the
\emph{up} structure the absolute maximum is found near to 0.042\,eV reaching a
value of 70$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V for the $\chi^{yxx} $ tensor component
which contribution comes from the imaginary part of the spectra. In table
\ref{tab:shgcomp} we show a comparison of the maximum SHG reported for
different structures.

\section{Conclusions} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have performed \emph{ab initio} calculations for the spin and current injection and
Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) on the hydrogenated graphene C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures (Fig. \ref{fig:structures}) with the
independent particle approximation (IPA). Our calculations predicts that it is
possible to inject spin-polarized electrons along the perpendicular direction
to the surface plane, obtaining a degree of spin polarization (DSP) of the
injected electrons about 39\% and 57\%  (Fig. \ref{fig:Da}) at the photon energies of around 0.719
and 0.08\,Ha  for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. Also there is a range of energy
in which this DSP can be held, from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV and from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. This results predicts that particularly
the \emph{up} structure is usable for spintronics proposes. Also, our results
about the optical current injection (OCI) with circularly polarized light (CPL)
show that the \emph{alt}  and \emph{up} systems have a response near to 3.70
and 28.0\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:eta}) for incident beams with energies of around
1.25 and 0.09\,eV. According to measurements already done on bulk materials, it
is actually possible to measure such amount of injection current density. Thus 
the control of the motion of the electron at the
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures is possible by incidence of circularly
polarized light. Finally we found that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures
present a absolute maximum of 0.6$\times 10^{6}$ and 70.0\,$\times 10^{6}
$\,pm$^{2}$/V (Fig. \ref{fig:shg-abs-both}) at the photon energies of around 0.40 and 0.042\,eV.
According to these results we can say that our systems of study in this paper are
usable to SHG, principally the \emph{up} system.
