conduction bands. Current injection and second-harmonic generation are
nonlinear, second-order effects that can be produced from both the bulk and

anisotropic behavior. We obtain a maximum degree of spin polarization of 39\%
for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt, and 57\% for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up, which are
promising results for potential applications in spintronics.}}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Graphene is an allotrope of carbon with a planar, hexagonal, two-dimensional honeycomb structure with one carbon atom at each vertex \cite{geimNM07}. In first instance it was made by graphite exfoliation \cite{geimNM07} and actually its growth is better controlled by chemical vapor deposition \cite{reinaNL08}. It has attracted great interest due to its distinctive properties, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect at room temperature \cite{bottegoniAPL13}, optical absorption \cite{thongrattanasiriPRL12}, thermal conductivity \cite{balandinNL08}. Graphene behaves like a metal \cite{geimNM07}, but it is possible to tune the band gap by increasing the surface area using lithographic processes \cite{hanPRL07}, application of an electric field \cite{zhangN09}, applying uniaxial strain \cite{niACSN08} or doping by depletion of the substrate's dopant carriers \cite{ohtaS06}, with B and N \cite{guoIJ11} or hydrogen \cite{eliasS09,guisingerNL09,samarakoonACSN10}. The band gap opening process by doping occurs due to the modification of the carbon-carbon bonds of the graphene structure and then producing a semiconducting material.

In this paper we present a study on two hydrogenated graphene structures. It is possible to obtain different spatial configurations by varying the amount and location of the hydrogen bonds. Our cases are the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures. Both of these cases have 50\% hydrogenation, and present a discernible band gap. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}, when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom of the graphene plane, it pulls the carbon atom from the original position modifying the carbon-carbon bond length, and then opening the band gap \cite{samarakoonACSN10}. The \emph{alt} case (Fig. \ref{fig:altstrc}) has hydrogen on both sides of the sheet, alternating between the upper and lower faces of the plane. The \emph{up} case (Fig. \ref{fig:upstrc}) has all the hydrogens on a single side, producing a zig-zag form in the carbon lattice. In this paper we made a theoretical study of three optical nonlinear phenomena in the structures mentioned above: the degree of spin polarization (DSP) along a given $a$ direction, $D^{a}$, optical current injection along a given $a$ direction, $\mathbf{\dot{J}}^{a}$, and second-harmonic generation (SHG). We describe these as follows.

\subsection{Degree of spin polarization}

The injection and detection of spin polarized electrons into nonmagnetic materials is the core of spintronics \cite{vzuticRMP04,fertRMP08} and an important  problem in condensed matter theory.
The idea of using light for spin polarization and its detection dates to the 1960s \cite{LampelPRL68}. Later, it was shown that conversion of angular momentum of light into electron spin and vice versa is very efficient in III-IV semiconductors \cite{dyakonovOO84}. The optical spin injection is characterized through the dimensionless quantity of DSP, $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$, which is a function of the photon frequency, $\omega$. The DSP quantifies the fraction of injected electrons into the conduction bands that are spin polarized.
The process of optical spin injection appears when circularly polarized light is incident on a semiconducting material \cite{dyakonovOO84}. This allows spin polarized electrons to move from the valence to the conduction bands and the resulting polarization is produced by interaction between the electron spin and its motion caused by the spin-orbit coupling in the material. It can be calculated with full band structure local- density approximation (LDA), and $\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ methods \cite{nastosPRB07,cabellosPRB09}. There are theoretical reports of DSP calculations for bulk media (Si, GaAs, CdSe, and Ge semiconductors) \cite{nastosPRB07,cabellosPRB09} and surfaces (Si(111):In, Si(111):As, GaAs(110):Sb, GaAs(110), and Si(111) with $4\times2$ and $8\times2$ reconstructions) \cite{mendozaPRB12,arzatePRB14}. 

\subsection{Optical current injection}

The understanding and control of structure and chemistry at bulk and surface systems is of fundamental and technological interest. The optical current injection, $\mathbf{\dot{J}}(\omega)$ , is a surface-sensitive optical effect that offers the potential to control chemical reactions \cite{bhatPRB05,hachePRL97}. This is a second-order optical nonlinear effect associated with the more strongly divergent part of 􏰡$\chi_{2}(0;\omega,\omega)$ \cite{sipePRB00}. In noncentrosymmetric crystals, a photocurrent can be injected with a single optical beam coming  from the interference of one-photon absorption processes associated with different linear polarizations of the light \cite{sipePRB00}. From the total of the 32 crystal classes only 21 has not inversion of symmetry and this process is only allowed in 18 of them. Crystals corresponding to the $\bar{6}m\bar{2}$, $\bar{6}$, and $\bar{4}$$\bar{3}$m are the exceptions. The one-photon current injection is characterized by the current injection tensor, $\eta(0; \omega, − \omega)$, which is a particular case of the current injection tensor $\eta(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}; \omega_{1},-\omega_{2})$, where $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ are the frequencies of two different optical fields. We write the frequency dependence of the injection current tensor as $\eta(\omega)$ instead of $\eta(0; \omega, − \omega)$. This process can be understood as a quantum interference between absorption events associated with different linear polarizations. The energy intensification of the promoted carriers is produced by the electromagnetic field till the rise in momentum is provided by the crystal lattice. The process of optical current injection can be generated in bulk semiconductors \cite{hachePRL97,sipePRB00}, two-dimensional (2D) systems \cite{melePRB00,cabellosPRB11}, and one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes \cite{melePRB00}. 

\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}

The characterization of structures and interfaces is an important issue in the development of microelectronics, nanomaterials, semiconductors, and other areas of interest in science and technology. Much of this research has been produced from experiments that emerge from the emission or scattering of electrons from the structures under study. These require ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and provide no access to buried systems. Secon-harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear process in which a pair of photons of same frequency area annihilated to produce new photons with twice the energy, twice of energy and half of wavelength of the initial photons. The SHG spectroscopy technique brings the possibility of study properties of media and has a non invasive, nondestructive and surface sensitive nature. The process is suitable with non-UHV conditions even if the systems is buried under transparent overlayers. The macroscopic basis of SHG, which describe the phase, intensity, and polarization of detected fields to nonlinear and linear susceptibilities at the material interface is described in \cite{downerSIA01}.In non centrosymmetric media the bulk SHG signal of centrosymmetric materials is identically zero but the SHG process can occur at the surface where the inversion symmetry is broken. Using this technique it is possible to characterize properties like phase transitions, atomic structure, molecular and atomic physisorption, structure deformation, and many others \cite{dadapPRB97,godefroyAPL96,salazarPRB14,mendozaPRL98}. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \ref{sec:theory} we present the theory and formulas that describe the DSP, optical current injection, and SHG. In Sec. \ref{sec:results} we describe the details of the calculations and the corresponding spectra for the respective \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures. Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec. \ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

In this section we present a brief description of the formalism that describes the three phenomena presented here since they have already been reported before with full details. The reader can check all the derivations for the DSP in Refs. \cite{nastosPRB07,mendozaPRB12}, optical current injection in Refs. \cite{cabellosPRB11,sipePRB00}, and SHG in Refs. \cite{nastosPRB05,andersonPRB15}.


\subsection{Optical spin injection}\label{sec:theory-DSP}

The DSP, $\mathcal{D}^{a}$, along a given direction, $a$, is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:da}
\mathcal{D}^{a}=\frac{\dot{S}^{abc}(\omega)}{(\hbar/2)\dot{n}^{bc}(\omega)},
\end{equation}
where the spin generation rate, $\dot{S}^{abc}(\omega)$, and the carrier generation rate, $\dot{n}^{bc}(\omega)$,  are given by 
\begin{align*}
\dot{S}^{abc}(\omega) &= \zeta^{abc}(\omega)E^{b}(-\omega)E^{c}(\omega), \nonumber \\ 
\dot{n}^{bc}(\omega)  &= \xi^{bc}E^{b}(-\omega)E^{c}(\omega),
\end{align*}
from where $\zeta^{abc}$ is the spin injection rate tensor and $\xi^{bc}$ is the carrier generation rate tensor. The spin injection rate tensor is given by
\begin{align*}\label{eq:zeta}
\zeta^{abc} &= \frac{i\pi e^{2}}{\hbar^{2}}\int\frac{d^{3}k}{8\pi^{3}}
\sum_{vcc'}^{\prime}\text{Im}\bigl[S^{a}_{c'c}(\textbf{k})
r^{b}_{vc'}(\textbf{k})r^{c}_{cv}(\textbf{k})\nonumber\\
&\qquad+S^{a}_{cc'}(\textbf{k})
r^{b}_{vc}(\textbf{k})r^{c}_{c'v}(\textbf{k})\bigr]
\delta(\omega_{cv}(\textbf{k})-\omega),
\end{align*}
where $S$ and $r$ are the spin and position matrix elements. The carrier generation rate tensor is related to the linear optical response tensor by 
\begin{equation*}
\xi^{bc}=Im[(2/\hbar)\chi^{bc}].
\end{equation*}

The superscripts in previous expressions denote the three Cartesian coordinates. We assume an incoming beam of CPL at normal incidence that propogates along the $-z$ direction, $\mathbf{E}(\omega) = E_{0}(\omega)(\hat{x} - i\hat{y})/\sqrt{2}$. Then, the expression of Eq. \eqref{eq:da} can be reduced to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:D^i}
D^{a}(\omega) = 
\frac{-4i\zeta^{axy}(\omega)}
    {\hbar\left[\xi^{xx}(\omega) + \xi^{yy}(\omega)\right]}.
\end{equation}
It is possible to generate current injection along all three directions with
an incident CPL beam.


\subsection{Optical current injection}\label{sec:theory-OCI}

The optical current injection is defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\dot{J}}^{a}_{\text{inj}}(\omega) =
\eta^{abc}(\omega)E_{b}(\omega)E_{c}(\omega), \label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}
where $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is the surface injection current tensor and is given by
\begin{align*}
\eta^{abc}(\omega) =& \frac{i\pi e^{3}}{\hbar^{2}}\int\frac{d^{3}k}{8\pi^{3}}
\nonumber \\
\times &
\sum_{vc}\Delta^{a}_{cv}(\mathbf{k})\text{Im}\big[r^{b}_{cv}(\mathbf{k})
r^{c}_{cv}(\mathbf{k})\big]\delta(\omega_{cv}(\mathbf{k})-\omega).
\end{align*}
from where $r$ is the position matrix elements and 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta^{a}_{cv} = v^{a}_{cc}(\mathbf{k})-v^{a}_{vv}(\mathbf{k}),
\end{equation*}
where $v^{a}_{nn}(\mathbf{k})=p^{a}_{nn}(\mathbf{k})/m_{e}$ is the electron velocity for a given $n$ band.

The tensor $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is purely imaginary and is antisymmetric with respect to the last two indices, \emph{b} and \emph{c} \cite{sipePRB00,nastosPRB06}. Like in optical spin injection, it is possible to generate current injection along all three directions with an incident CPL beam.


\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}\label{sec:theory-SHG}

For the SHG we followed the the new formalism derived in reference \cite{andersonPRB15}. This formalism to calculate the second order susceptibility tensor is calculated, including in one unique formulation (i) the scissors correction, (ii) the contributionof the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, and (iii) the derivation for the inclusion of the cut function. For our calculation we used the cut function equal to one recovering then the response of the complete system.

The second order nonlinear polarization is given by 
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:pol}
\mathcal{P}(2\omega) = \chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)E^{b}(\omega)E^{c}(\omega)
\end{equation*}
where $\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor responsible for the SHG and satisfies the $\chi^{abc}$ = $\chi^{acb}$ condition. Again, the superscripts in previous expression denotes the Cartesian coordinates and if repeated are to be summed over. The expressions for the imaginary part of the tensor components $\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ at $1\omega$ and $2\omega$ are divided in the interband ($e$) and intraband ($i$) contributions. They correspond to transitions between the conduction and valence bands and transitions between levels within the conduction or valence band, respectively. This expressions are given by
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:chis}
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,\omega}] =  
\frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}\int 
&
\frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}  
\nonumber \\
\times \sum_{vc}\sum_{q\neq(v,c)}
\frac{1}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
&

\right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\mathrm{Im}  [\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{i,\omega}]= 
\frac{\pi\vert e\vert^3}{2\hbar^2}
&
\int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}

\nonumber \\

r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}
\Delta^{\mathrm{c}}_{cv}\right\}\right]}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}} 
\Bigg]
\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,2\omega}]= -
&
\frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}\int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
\nonumber \\
\times \sum_{vc}\frac{4}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
&
\Bigg[
\sum_{v'\ne v}\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathbf{v}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\{r^{\mathrm{

{2\omega^\Sigma_{cv'}-\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
\nonumber \\

\Bigg]
\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-2\omega),
\end{align}

.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathbf{v}^{\Sigma}_{nm}$ is the complete velocity matrix elements defined as
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:nonlocal}
\mathbf{v}^{\Sigma}=\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{nl}}+\mathbf{v}^{S},
\end{equation*}
from where $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{nl}}$ includes the nonlocal contribution, and $\mathbf{v}^{S}$ the scissors correction. Lastly, $r^{\mathrm{a}}_{nm}$ is the position matrix elements, and $\omega^\Sigma_{nm}$=$\omega^{\Sigma}_{n}$-$\omega^{\sigma}_{m}$. The real part of each contribution can be obtained through a Kramers-Kronig transformation \cite{tancognePRB14} and
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:chitotal}
    \chi^{abc} = \chi^{abc}_{e,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{e,2\omega} +
    \chi^{abc}_{i,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{i,2\omega}
    .
\end{equation*}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

We present the results of the numerical calculations for {$D^{a}$}, {$\eta^{axy}$}, and $\chi^{abc}$ for the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}. Both systems are infinite carbon system with 50\% of hydrogenation in two different arrangements. The \emph{alt} arrangement has alternating hydrogen bonds in the upper and lower sides of the carbon sheet, and the \emph{up} arrangement has them only on the upper side. Both structures are non-centrosymmetric and have a thickness of 2.96\,{\AA} and 1.46\,{\AA}, respectively. Due to the hydrogenation the planar like graphene hexagonal geometry is broken and both structures fall in the primitive triclinic $P1$ space group. The corresponding coordinates in angstroms (\AA) for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures are presented in Tables \ref{tab:altstrc} and \ref{tab:upstrc}.



In this work we used the ABINIT code \cite{torrentCMS08} for the calculation of the self-consistent ground state and the Kohn-Sham states using DFT-LDA with a planewave basis in the IPA. We used Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH) relativistic separable dual-space Gaussian pseudopotentials \cite{hartwigsenPRB98} that include spin-orbit interaction for calculating $D^{i}$ and {$\eta^{ixy}$}, although the latter can also be calculated with pseudopotentials that lack this interaction. For $\chi^{abc}$ we used Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials \cite{troullierPRB91} that are fully separable nonlocal pseudopotentials in the Kleiman-Bylander form \cite{kleinmanPRL82}. The contribution from the nonlocal part used in Eq. \eqref{eq:nonlocal} is carried out using the DP code \cite{olevanoDP}. We used cutoff energies of 65\,Ha and 40\,Ha for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. The energy eigenvalues and matrix elements were calculated using 14452 \textbf{k} for \emph{alt} and 8452 \textbf{k} points for \emph{up}, in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ).


\subsection{Optical spin injection}\label{subsec:results-DSP}

In Fig. \ref{fig:Da} we show the $D^{i}$ spectra for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up. Values over (under) zero define a positive (negative) direction of spin polarization along the \emph{i} direction. For both cases, the system response begins when the energy of the incoming light is larger than the gap energy. For \emph{alt} this occurs near 0.7185\,eV and for \emph{up} this occurs near 0.078\,eV. Both cases have at least one {$D^{a}$} with more than 30\% of DSP. For \emph{up} we have nearly 60\% DSP in the $z$ direction, and for \emph{alt} nearly 40\% DSP in the $x$ and $y$ directions. The \emph{alt} structure presents an energy range between 0.7185\,eV and 0.72\,eV where it is possible to have the maximum value for $D^{a}$ in all directions. After 0.72\,eV, the DSP declines for all three components. Likewise, the \emph{up} system presents maximum values between 0.078\,eV to 0.081\,eV, and after 0.081\,eV the DSP slowly vanishes. 

In Table \ref{tab:dacomp} we present a comparison of the absolute maximum values of $D^{a}$ for different materials and the corresponding direction and energy at which they are reached. From this table we have that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems have less DSP than the Si(111)-As 1$\times$1 and the the bulk CdSe system, but are comparable to the Si(111)-In 8$\times$2, bulk Si, and bulk GaAs systems. Si(111)-In 8$\times$2 and \emph{alt} both have maxima around 0.7\,eV, which is the near infrared range. Conversely, the maxima for Si(111)-As 1$\times$1, bulk Si, and bulk GaAs all occur in the optical energy range.

As mentioned previously, the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases both have much larger energy ranges for the maximum DSP values in all directions. This compares very favorably with the other systems, that have very narrow ranges over which the maximum DSP is achieved. The 0.7\,eV maxima for \emph{alt} makes it an interesting candidate for further study, as this energy is readily obtainable using modern laser systems.

\subsection{Optical current injection}\label{subsec:results-eta}

Fig. \ref{fig:eta} depicts the spectra obtained for the current tensor components $\eta^{axy}$ from the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems in. As with DSP, the onset of the system response occurs when the incident light achieves an energy above the gap. For \emph{alt} this occurs near 0.7185\,eV and for \emph{up} this occurs near 0.078\,eV.

Values over (under) zero define a positive (negative) direction of the current injection along the \emph{a} direction. As was mentioned before in Sec. \ref{sec:theory-OCI} for this case of CPL the $\eta^{abc}$ has only non zero components when the last two indexes are $xy$. So we report the three components, $xxy$, $yxy$, and $zxy$ , corresponding to the three Cartesian components.

We see that for the \emph{alt} system we have a positive maximum in the \emph{y} direction at an energy of 1.25\,eV, reaching a value of 1.95\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. For \emph{up} we obtain the maximum in the \emph{y} direction at an energy of 0.09\,eV, with a value of 18\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. The response goes to zero after 1.75\,eV and 0.2\,eV for \emph{alt} and \emph{up}, respectively.

In table \ref{tab:etacomp} we present a comparison of the absolute maximum values of $\eta^{abc}$ reported for different materials and the corresponding direction and enerby at which the maximum is reached. 

From the table we can see that, excluding the case of the bulk CdSd, \emph{alt} reaches a larger value for $\eta^{abc}$ than some of the systems and is in the same order of magnitude that the Si(111) 2$\times$1 system and almos for the same photon energy, 1.25\,eV, which is in the which is the near infrared range. 

\emph{up} structure has the same order of magnitude as the bulk CdSd both in this case for a lower energy of the incoming beam.\

The reference \cite{lamanAPL99} includes a report in which an experiment was performed using a single-frequency beam to produce OCI in bulk CdSe. The experiment demostrated that the current injection has a  linearly proportional dependence whti the beam intensity and then makeing the confirming about that the intensity and spectral dependence are in reasonable agreement with a first-principles calculation. They measured an OCI of 2\,$\mu$A/cm$^{2}$ that penetrated 1.8\,$\mu$/cm$^{2}$. The corresponding value of $\eta^{axy}$ is reported in Table \ref{tab:etacomp}.

\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}
All spectra featured here include the contribution from the nonlocal part of
the pseudopotentials, as detailed in Sec. \ref{sec:theory-SHG}. In Figs.
\ref{fig:alt-shg-abs} and \ref{fig:up-shg-abs} we show the absolute value of the different nonzero
components of $\chi^{abc}$ for both cases. For \emph{alt}, we note that all
components except $xxy$ present two peaks at $\sim0.5$\,eV and $\sim1.0$\,eV.
The first peak is completely produced by $2\omega$ resonances, while the
second peak is produced by a mixture of both $1\omega$ and $2\omega$
resonances, with the latter dominating in most cases. The $xxy$ component has
a single broadened peak with a discernible feature near 0.5\,eV. That feature,
much like the other components, is produced by $2\omega$ resonances, while the
maxima is produced by a mixture of both frequencies.

For \emph{up} we see one predominant peak around 0.05\,eV, completely produced
by $2\omega$ transitions. The $xxy$ and $yxx$ components have an additional
feature close to 0.09\,eV dominated by $1\omega$ transitions.

In table \ref{tab:shgcomp} we show a comparison of the maximum $\chi^{abc}$
peak reported for different structures. This table is merely available for
qualitative comparison.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have performed \emph{ab initio} calculations for the optical spin injection (DSP), optical current injection (OCI), and second-harmonic generation (SHG) on the hydrogenated graphene C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures, (Fig. \ref{fig:structures}) using the independent particle approximation (IPA) and the plane wabe basis. Our calculations abour DSP predicts that it is possible to inject spin-polarized electrons along the three cartesian directions, obtaining maxima DSP of the injected electrons of about 39\% and 57\% in the $y$ and $z$ directions  (Fig. \ref{fig:Da}) at the photon energies of around 0.719 and 0.08\,Ha  for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. Also there is a range of energy in which this DSP can be held, from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV and from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. This results predicts that particularly \emph{up} is usable for spintronics proposes because its energy is readily obtainable using modern laser systems

Our results about OCI with circularly polarized light (CPL) show that the \emph{alt}  and \emph{up} systems have a response near to 1.95\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$ and 18.0\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$ both in the $y$ direction (Fig. \ref{fig:eta}) for incident beams with energies of around 1.25 and 0.09\,eV. According to measurements done on bulk materials, it is actually possible to measure such amount of OCI. According to this result we can affir that it is possible to control the motion of electrons in both systems but specially in the \emph{up} one in the $y$ direction.

Finally we found that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures present a absolute maximum of 0.32\,$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V and 37.0\,$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V at the photon energies of around 0.40\,eV and 0.042\,eV (Figs. \ref{fig:alt-shg-abs} and \ref{fig:up-shg-abs}). For \emph{alt} and \emph{up} we have that their maximua come from contributions of the 2$\omega$ resonances. From this we comclude that specially with the \emph{up} system is usable to SHG.
