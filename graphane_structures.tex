\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Graphene is an allotrope of carbon with a planar, hexagonal, two-dimensional
honeycomb structure with one carbon atom at each vertex, as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:structures}. It has attracted a great deal of interest due to its
distinctive properties, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect at room
temperature, and excellent thermal transport properties
\cite{geimNM07,reinaNL08,novoselov2S7,balandinNL08}. It behaves
like a metal, but can be modified to semiconductor behavior by tuning the band
gap. This can be achieved by changing the surface area \cite{hanPRL07},
applying an electric field \cite{zhangN09}, applying uniaxial strain
\cite{niACSN08}, or by doping, amongst other methods. Previous works have
explored doping with boron, nitrogen \cite{guoIJ11}, and hydrogen
\cite{eliasS09,guisingerNL09,samarakoonACSN10}.

Hydrogenated graphene can obtain different spatial configurations by varying
the amount and location of the hydrogen bonds. In this paper we present a
study of two 50\% hydrogenated graphene structures, C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up (Figs. \ref{fig:altstrc} and \ref{fig:upstrc}), both
presenting a discernible band gap. When a hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon
atom in graphene, it draws the atom away from the plane. This modifies the
carbon-carbon bond length resulting in an opening of the band gap
\cite{samarakoonACSN10}. The C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt case has hydrogen on both
sides of the carbon sheet, alternating between the upper and lower faces,
while the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up case has all the hydrogens on a single side,
producing a zig-zag form in the carbon lattice. We conduct a theoretical study
of three optical nonlinear phenomena for our two cases: the optical spin
injection, the optical current injection, and second-harmonic generation
(SHG). We describe these as follows.

\subsection{Optical spin injection}

The injection and detection of spin polarized electrons into nonmagnetic
materials is the core of spintronics \cite{vzuticRMP04,fertRMP08} and an
important problem in condensed matter theory. Our concern is with the
production of spin polarization from light \cite{LampelPRL68}, and this
conversion from the angular momentum of light into electron spin is very
efficient in III-IV semiconductors \cite{dyakonovOO84}. The optical spin
injection is characterized through the dimensionless degree of spin
polarization (DSP), $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}(\omega)$. The DSP quantifies the
fraction of injected electrons into the conduction bands that are spin
polarized. This effect occurs when circularly polarized light is incident on a
semiconducting material \cite{dyakonovOO84}, thus allowing electrons to move
from the valence to the conduction bands. The resulting polarization is
produced by the interaction between the electron spin and its motion caused by
the spin-orbit coupling in the material. DSP can be calculated with a full
band structure method as shown in Refs. \cite{nastosPRB07,cabellosPRB09}.
There are theoretical reports of DSP calculations for bulk media (Si, GaAs,
CdSe, and Ge semiconductors)
\cite{nastosPRB07,cabellosPRB09} and surfaces (Si(111):In, Si(111):As,
GaAs(110):Sb, GaAs(110), and Si(111) with $4\times2$ and $8\times2$
reconstructions) \cite{mendozaPRB12,arzatePRB14}.


\subsection{Optical current injection}

The optical current injection is a second-order optical nonlinear effect that
has been the subject of research in recent years
\cite{arzatePRB14,bhatPRB05,fraserPRL99,hachePRL97,lamanAPL99}. A
photocurrent, $\mathbf{\dot{J}}(\omega)$, can be injected with a single
optical beam in noncentrosymmetric materials or at the surface of bulk
centrosymmetric materials where the symmetry inversion is broken
\cite{arzatePRB14}. This phenomenon results from the interference of one-
photon absorption processes associated with different linear polarizations of
the light. In the process of current injection, the energy increase of the
injected carriers is provided by the electromagnetic field, meanwhile the
increase in momentum is provided by the crystal lattice \cite{arzatePRB14}.
The one-photon current injection is characterized by the current injection
tensor, $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$, and since it is generated with circularly
polarized light, this phenomenon is also called the circular photovoltaic
effect \cite{sturmanCRCP92}. This effect has been studied in bulk
semiconductors \cite{hachePRL97,sipePRB00}, two-dimensional systems
\cite{melePRB00,cabellosPRB11}, and one-dimensional nanotubes
\cite{melePRB00}. The two structures in this study, C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up, are noncentrosymmetric both presenting an optical current
injection response.


\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}
\begin{changed}
Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical process, in which pairs of photons with the same frequency, $\omega$, interacting with a nonlinear media are annihilated to generate new photons with twice the frequency and half the wavelength of the initial photons. In the dipole approximation SHG is restricted to the surfaces of centrosymmetric materials, making it an excellent surface probe. SHG spectroscopy techniques bring the possibility to study properties of materials and has a non invasive, nondestructive and surface sensitive nature. The two cases in this study, C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up, are noncentrosymmetric and thus present SHG from the entire structure being efficient SHG generators.
\end{changed}

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \ref{sec:theory} we present the
theory and formulas that describe the DSP, optical current injection, and SHG.
In Sec. \ref{sec:results} we describe the details of the calculations and the
corresponding spectra for the respective \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures.
Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec. \ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

In this section we report a summary of the theory for the three phenomena of
interest. For full details see Refs. \cite{nastosPRB07,mendozaPRB12} for DSP,
Refs. \cite{cabellosPRB11,sipePRB00} for optical current injection, and Ref.
\cite{andersonPRB15} for SHG. 
\begin{changed}
In the following mathematical expressions
presented in this section the superscripts denote Cartesian directions and if
repeated are to be summed over.
\end{changed}

\subsection{Optical spin injection}\label{sec:theory-DSP}

The DSP, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}(\omega)$, along a given $a$ direction is
defined as
$\mathcal{D}^{a}(\omega)=\dot{S}^{a}(\omega)/(\hbar/2)\dot{n}(\omega)$
\cite{mendozaPRB12}. The spin generation rate, $\dot{S}^{a}(\omega)$, and the
carrier generation rate, $\dot{n}(\omega)$, are given by
\begin{align}
\dot{S}^{a}(\omega)&= 
\zeta^{abc}(\omega)E^{b}(-\omega)E^{c}(\omega), \label{eq:spinrate} \\
\dot{n}(\omega)&= 
\xi^{ab}E^{a}(-\omega)E^{b}(\omega), \label{eq:carrierrate}
\end{align}
where $\zeta^{abc}(\omega)$ are the spin injection rate tensor components and
$\xi^{bc}(\omega)$ are the carrier generation rate tensor components
\cite{arzatePRB14}. Then, assuming an incoming circularly polarized beam at
normal incidence that propagates along the $-z$ direction, $\mathbf{E}(\omega)
= E_{0}(\omega)(\mathbf{\hat{x}} - i\mathbf{\hat{y}})/\sqrt{2}$, with $E_{0}$
as the intensity, we obtain $\mathcal{D}^{a}(\omega)$ from Eqs.
\eqref{eq:spinrate} and \eqref{eq:carrierrate} \cite{arzatePRB14} as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:D^i}
\mathcal{D}^{a}(\omega) =  
\frac{-4i\zeta^{axy}(\omega)}
    {\hbar\left(\xi^{xx}(\omega) + \xi^{yy}(\omega)\right)},
\end{equation}
where, for both structures considered here, $\xi^{ab}(\omega)$ is diagonal. 
\begin{changed}
Since $E(\omega)$ lies on the surface of the structure, it can be taken, with the usual neglect of local field corrections, as uniform through the interface region \cite{mendozaPRB12}.
\end{changed}
Also, it is possible to generate current injection along all three orthogonal
Cartesian directions with an incident circularly polarized beam and so the
absolute DSP can be obtained by \cite{arzatePRB14}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dsptotal}
\mathcal{D}(\omega) =
\sqrt{(\mathcal{D}^{x}(\omega))^{2} + 
      (\mathcal{D}^{y}(\omega))^{2} +
      (\mathcal{D}^{z}(\omega))^{2}
      }.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Optical current injection}\label{sec:theory-OCI}

The optical current injection along a given $a$ direction is defined
\cite{arzatePRB14} as
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\dot{J}}^{a}_{\text{inj}}(\omega) =
\eta^{abc}(\omega)E_{b}(\omega)E_{c}(\omega), \label{eq:current}
\end{equation*}
where $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is the current injection tensor which quantifies
the current injection along the $a$ direction that is optically injected by a
circularly polarized beam at normal incidence in the $-z$  direction,
$\mathbf{E}(\omega) = E_{0}(\omega)(\mathbf{\hat{x}} -
i\mathbf{\hat{y}})/\sqrt{2}$, where $E_{0}$ is again the intensity. For a
layered system we have that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta}
\eta^{abc}_{\mathrm{Total}}(\omega)=
\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_{\mathrm{eff}}}\eta^{abc}(\ell|\omega)
\end{equation}
where $\eta^{abc}(\ell|\omega)$ gives the contribution from the corresponding
$\ell^{\mathrm{th}}$ layer to the injection current tensor. The sum in Eq.
\eqref{eq:eta} is carried out from the top layer, $\ell=1$, to
$\ell=N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, that is the resulting values for the tensor components
have contributions from the $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ layers that extend to an
effective length, $\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}$. $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ has the
characteristic to be purely imaginary and is antisymmetric with respect to the
last two Cartesian indices, $b$ and $c$
\cite{arzatePRB14,sipePRB00,nastosPRB10}. Like in optical spin injection, it is
possible to generate current injection along all three directions with an
incident circularly polarized beam. Analogously to Eq.
\eqref{eq:dsptotal} it is possible to have the absolute $\eta(\omega)$
\cite{arzatePRB14} as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:etatotal}
\eta(\omega) =
\sqrt{(\eta^{xxy}(\omega))^{2} +
      (\eta^{yxy}(\omega))^{2} +
      (\eta^{zxy}(\omega))^{2}
      }.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}\label{sec:theory-SHG}

\begin{changed}
The second-order nonlinear polarization is given by
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:pol}
\mathcal{P}(2\omega) = 
\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)E^{b}(\omega)E^{c}(\omega)
\end{equation*} where $\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor responsible for the SHG that satisfies permutation symmetry condition and, as mentioned before,  if the superscripts are repeated, then are to be summed over. The expressions for the imaginary part of the tensor components $\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)]$ for $1\omega$ and $2\omega$ are divided into interband ($e$) and intraband ($i$) as follows, 
\begin{align*}\label{eq:chiim}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{abc} (-2\omega;\omega,\omega)] &=
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{abc}_{e,\omega}] + \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{abc}_{e,2\omega}] \\
& + 
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{abc}_{i,\omega}] + \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{abc}_{i,2\omega}].
\end{align*}
They include the contribution from the
nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials the scissors correction. The real part
of each contribution can be obtained through a Kramers-Kronig transformation
\cite{tancognePRB14} and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chitotal}
\chi^{abc} (-2\omega;\omega,\omega) =
\chi^{abc}_{e,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{e,2\omega} +
\chi^{abc}_{i,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{i,2\omega}.
\end{equation}
\end{changed}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

We present the results for {$D^{a}(\omega)$}, {$\eta^{abc}(\omega)$}, and
$\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ for the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures. Both cases are semi-infinite carbon systems with
50\% of hydrogenation in two different arrangements. The \emph{alt} system has
alternating hydrogen atoms on the upper and bottom sides of the carbon sheet,
while the \emph{up} system has H only on the upper side. Both structures are
noncentrosymmetric and have a thickness of 2.944\,{\AA} and 2.766\,{\AA}. The
corresponding coordinates in Angstroms (\AA) for the \emph{alt} and
\emph{up} unit cells of the structures are presented in Tables
\ref{tab:altstrc} and \ref{tab:upstrc}, with the corresponding layer divisions.
We take the carbon honeycomb lattice to be in the $xy$ plane for both
structures and the carbon-hydrogen bonds in the perpendicular $xz$ plane as
shown in Fig.\ref{fig:graphenestrc}. In order to represent the directions where
the absolute values of the $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$ and $\eta(\omega)$ (Eqns.
\eqref{eq:dsptotal} and \eqref{eq:etatotal}) we define the azimuthal angle
$\varphi$ in the $xy$ plane and the polar angle $\theta$ in the $xz$ plane both
measured positive in the counterclockwise starting from $x$, as usual in the
polar coordinate system, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}.

\end{table}

We used the ABINIT code \cite{gonzeCPC09} for the calculation of the self-
consistent ground state and the Kohn-Sham states using density functional
theory in the local density approximation (DFT-LDA) with a planewave basis. We
used Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH) relativistic separable dual-space
Gaussian pseudopotentials \cite{hartwigsenPRB98} that include spin-orbit
interaction for calculating $D^{a}(\omega)$. For the calculations of
{$\eta^{abc}(\omega)$} and $\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ we used
Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials \cite{troullierPRB91} that are fully
separable nonlocal pseudopotentials in the Kleiman-Bylander form
\cite{kleinmanPRL82}. These are required for calculating the contribution from
the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials in the SHG response. This calculation
is carried out using the DP code \cite{olevanoDP}. For convergence of our
results we used a cutoff energies of 65\,Ha and 40\,Ha and the energy
eigenvalues and matrix elements were calculated using 14452 \textbf{k} points
and 8452 \textbf{k} points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) for the
\emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively.


\subsection{Optical spin injection}\label{subsec:results-DSP}

In Fig. \ref{fig:Da} we show the $D^{a}(\omega)$ spectra for the
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up systems resulting from the
evaluation of the Eq. \eqref{eq:D^i}. Values over (under) zero define a
positive (negative) direction of spin polarization along the \emph{a}
direction with respect the three Cartesian vectors shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:structures}. For both cases, the onset of the response is when the
energy of the incoming light is the same as the gap energy. For the \emph{alt}
system this occurs at 0.72\,eV and for the \emph{up} system at 0.08\,eV. Both
cases have at least one direction with more than 30\% DSP. The \emph{alt}
system presents nearly 40\% $\mathcal{D}^{a}(\omega)$ in the $x$ and $y$
directions and after 0.72\,eV the DSP rapidly vanishes. Using Eq.
\eqref{eq:dsptotal} we have that the \emph{alt} system presents an absolute
magnitude $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$ = 61\% for a frequency of 0.72\,eV with
$\varphi = -46^{\circ}$ and $\theta=35^{\circ}$. In Fig. \ref{fig:altstrc} the
dashed red arrow depicts how $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$ is oriented in the $xy$ and
$xz$ planes at the angles mentioned above. For the
\emph{up} structure we have nearly 60\% DSP in the $z$ direction. Using Eq.
\eqref{eq:dsptotal} we have that the \emph{up} structure presents an absolute
magnitude $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$ = 64\% for a frequency of 0.08\,eV,
with$\varphi = -18^{\circ}$ and $\theta = -62^{\circ}$. In Fig. 
\ref{fig:upstrc} the dashed red arrow depicts how $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$ is
oriented in the $xy$ and $xz$ planes at the angles mentioned above.

In Table \ref{tab:dacomp} we present a comparison of the absolute maximum
values of $\mathcal{D}^{a}(\omega)$ in a given direction for different
materials and the corresponding direction and energy at which they are
reached. From this table we have that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems
have less DSP than the Si(111)-As $1\times1$ and the the bulk CdSe cases, but
are comparable to the Si(111)-In $8\times2$, bulk Si, and bulk GaAs systems.
Si(111)-In $8\times2$ and \emph{alt} both have maxima around 0.72\,eV, which
is in the near infrared range. Conversely, the maxima for Si(111)-As
$1\times1$, bulk Si, and bulk GaAs all occur in the optical energy range. 
\begin{changed}
As
mentioned previously, the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases both have much larger
energy ranges for the maximum DSP values in all directions in comparison with
other structures. This compares very favorably with the other systems, that
have very narrow ranges over which the maximum DSP is achieved. The 0.7\,eV
maxima for \emph{alt} makes it an interesting candidate for further study, as
this energy is readily obtainable using terahertz radiation.

Figs. \ref{fig:alt-eta} and \ref{fig:up-eta} depict the spectra obtained for
the current injection tensor components, $\eta^{xxy}(\omega)$,
$\eta^{yxy}(\omega)$, and $\eta^{zxy}(\omega)$ for the
\emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems. The \emph{alt} system is divided into three
layers comprised of the top H atoms, the carbon plane, and the bottom H atoms.
The \emph{up} system is divided into two layers comprised of the top H atoms
and the carbon plane. The layer selection for the unit cells are shown
explicitely in Tables \ref{tab:altstrc} and \ref{tab:upstrc}.

\emph{alt} structure along with the layer by layer analysis in which we split
the the total response spectra in the corresponding contributions of each layer
mentioned above. We establish two energy values of interest for each structure
where there are large values for the response in the spectra. For the
\emph{alt} structure we choose $E_{1} = 0.97\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{2} =
1.31\,\mathrm{eV}$. For the layer by layer analysis corresponding to the
contributions of each atomic layer to the total response, we note that all
three layers contribute toward $\eta^{xxy}(\omega)$ at $E_{1}$ with the carbon
and top H layers providing the principal contributions. For $E_{2}$, the
dominating layers are the carbon and bottom H layers with minimal contribution
from the top H layer. For $E_{1}$, the $\eta^{yxy}(\omega)$ component is also
formed by contributions from all three layers but dominated by the sum of the
top and bottom H layers. The carbon layer response is negative at that point,
and destructively interferes with the response from the other two layers. For
$E_{2}$, the spectrum is completely dominated by the bottom H layer, with
almost no contribution from the others. Lastly, at $E_{1}$ the
$\eta^{zxy}(\omega)$ component is entirely produced from the carbon layer,
since the H layers provide no response whatsoever. This component is negligible
at $E_{2}$. We note that the response for all three components vanishes after
1.75\,eV. Using Eq. \eqref{eq:etatotal}, we find that the absolute current
injection $\eta(\omega)$, at $E_{1}$ is
$5.10\,\mathrm{mC}^{3}/\mathrm{J}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{2}$ with angles
$\varphi=116^{\circ}$ and $\theta=-172^{\circ}$. For $E_{2}$, we find that
$\eta(\omega)=2.32\,\mathrm{mC}^{3}/\mathrm{J}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{2}$ with angles
$\varphi=81^{\circ}$ and $\theta=12^{\circ}$. In Fig.
\ref{fig:altstrc}, the green dashed arrows represent the directions for
$\eta(\omega)$ for the $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ energy values. As mentioned
previously, $\varphi$ is located in the $xy$ plane, and $\theta$ is located in
the $xz$ plane.

Analogously, Fig. \ref{fig:up-eta} presents the three components for the full
\emph{up} structure along with the layer by layer spectra. We also establish
two energy values of interest for this structure, choosing $E_{1} =
0.09\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{2} = 0.10\,\mathrm{eV}$. For $E_{1}$, the carbon
layer dominates the total response for all three components. For $E_{2}$, the
carbon layer dominates for both $\eta^{yxy}(\omega)$ and $\eta^{zxy}(\omega)$,
but both the H and carbon layer contribute significantly to
$\eta^{xxy}(\omega)$. Identically to the \emph{alt} structure, the
$\eta^{zxy}(\omega)$ component presents no response from the H layer.  We note
that the response for all three components vanishes after 0.2\,eV.Using Eq.
\eqref{eq:etatotal}, we find that the absolute current injection $\eta(\omega)$,
at $E_{1}$ is $15.12\,\mathrm{mC}^{3}/\mathrm{J}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{2}$ with angles
$\varphi=58^{\circ}$ and $\theta=-54^{\circ}$. For $E_{2}$, we find that
$\eta(\omega)=7.62\,\mathrm{mC}^{3}/\mathrm{J}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{2}$ with angles
$\varphi=-157^{\circ}$ and $\theta=-131^{\circ}$. As before, we present the
directions for $\eta(\omega)$ in Fig. \ref{fig:upstrc} using green dashed
arrows.

In Table \ref{tab:etacomp} we present a comparison of the maximum values of
different components of $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ reported for different materials
and the corresponding energy at which they are achieved. Excluding bulk CdSe,
the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures have larger values for the current
injection tensor than the other materials. The Si(111)-In $8\times 2$ surface
has peak values close to 1.25\,eV, that is similar to the \emph{alt} structure.
However, the latter has more than six times the value of $\eta^{yxy}(\omega)$.
In Ref. \cite{lamanAPL99} includes the results of a one-photon experiment for
the optical current injection performed on bulk CdSe. They measured a current
injection density of 2\,$\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ that entered
1.8\,$\mu\mathrm{m}$ deep. In Table \ref{tab:etacomp} we also show the
corresponding experimental value for the surface current injection tensor of
this case.

\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}

Both the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures are triclinic class 1 systems
where all 27 components of $\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ are nonzero,
with 18 independent components \cite{popovbook}. In Figs. 
\ref{fig:shg-high-alt} and \ref{fig:shg-high-up} we present the absolute value
of the three largest components for each structure. For the \emph{alt} system,
we note that all components present two peaks around 0.5\,eV and 1.0\,eV. The
first peak is completely produced by $2\omega$ resonances, while the second
peak is produced by a mixture of both $1\omega$ and $2\omega$ resonances, with
the latter dominating for all components. The \emph{up} structure  has one
predominant peak around 0.04\,eV that is completely produced by $2\omega$
transitions. All components have an additional feature close to 0.09\,eV
dominated by $1\omega$ transitions.

Figs. \ref{fig:shg-lay-alt} and \ref{fig:shg-lay-up} present a layer by layer
analysis for the largest component of $|\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)|$
for each structure. For the \emph{alt} structure, the first feature of
$|\chi^{xyy}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)|$ is generated by contributions from all
three layers while the second feature is dominated by the carbon layer. For the
\emph{up} structure, $|\chi^{yxx}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)|$ is completely
dominated by the carbon plane with almost no response from the H layer.
Additionally, we note that both structures are very efficient at SHG, with
$\chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ values in the thousands of pm/V for
\emph{alt} and millions of pm/V for \emph{up}. The \emph{up} structure, with
only the H and carbon layers, has a high degree of noncentrosymmetry and is
therefore an excellent candidate for SHG. In table \ref{tab:shgcomp} we show a
comparison of the maximum response reported for different structures.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have performed \emph{ab initio} calculations for the DSP, optical current injection, and SHG on C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up hydrogenated graphene structures shown inf Figs. \ref{fig:altstrc} and \ref{fig:upstrc}. The DSP, optical current injection, and SHG response are very sensitive to the symmetry characteristics of the structures presenting an anisotropic behavior. 
We found that it is possible induce DSP along the all three Cartesian directions and we have that for the \emph{alt} structure the absolute magnitude $\mathcal{D}(\omega)=61\%$ fixed at $\varphi=-46^{\circ}$ and $\theta=35^{\circ}$ for a frequency of 0.72\,eV. For the \emph{up} structure we found that it presents an absolute magnitude $\mathcal{D}(\omega)=64\%$ in the fixed angles $\varphi=-18^{\circ}$ and $\theta=-62^{\circ}$ for a frequency of 0.08\,eV. According to this results both structures are good candidates for spintronics applications.
About the optical current injection with circularly polarized light we found that $\eta^{axy}(\omega)$ has components in the all three Cartesian directions for an incoming circularly polarized light beam propagating along the $-z$ direction being this behavior a result of a nonlinear effect in the media. 
For the \emph{alt} structure we found that the absolute current injection magnitude is $\eta(\omega)=5.10\,\mathrm{mC}^{3}/\mathrm{J}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{2}$ fixed at the angles $\varphi=116^{\circ}$ and $\theta=-172^{\circ}$ for a photon energy of 0.97\,eV and for the \emph{up} system the absolute current injection magnitude is $\eta(\omega)=15.12\,\mathrm{mC}^{3}/\mathrm{J}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{2}$ fixed at the angles $\varphi=58^{\circ}$ and $\theta=-54^{\circ}$.
Finally dealing with the SHG we found that both structures are efficient to produce this phenomenon. The highest value for the \emph{alt} structure is for the $|\chi^{xyy}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)|$ resching a value near to $3\times10^{3}\,\mathrm{pm/V}$ and the highest value for the \emph{up} structure correspond to the $|\chi^{yxx}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)|$ component reaching a value of $1.7\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{pm/V}$. From this we conclude that specially the \emph{up} structure is usable for SHG.
