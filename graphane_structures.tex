\begin{abstract}

We present a theoretical study of the optical generation of one-photon spin and
current injection and second harmonic generation onto {\altstc} and {\upstc} structures. The incidence of
circularly polarized light into nonmagnetic semiconductors produces spin-
polarized electrons in the conduction bands. The current injection and the
second harmonic generation are a nonlinear second-order effects that are
allowed in bulk and surface materials without inversion of symmetry; in bulk 
centrosymmetric crystals, the optical injection of current and second harmonic generation can
only be observed at the surface wherein the inversion of symmetry might be
broken. We report calculations for the degree of spin polarization, current
injection and second harmonic generation spectra which are calculated in a full
electronic band structure scheme at the level of DFT-LDA in the plane waves
approximation. Our results show an anisotropic behavior of the spin and
current injection and second harmonic generation optical responses. We obtain
maximum percentages of the degree of spin polarization of 48\% and 68\% for the
{\altstc} and {\upstc} structures, respectively. It is also possible to
optically generate injection current and second harmonic in the {\altstc} and
{\upstc} structures.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}


Graphene is an allotrope of carbon with a planar hexagonal two-dimensional
honeycomb structure or equilateral triangular crystal lattice in which one
carbon atom occupies a vertex \cite{geim2007rise}. In 2010 Geim and Novoselov
received the Nobel Prize for the research of properties about this material
\cite{geim2007rise}. Some of the properties of graphene are mechanical
strength, optical absorption coefficient and thermal conductivity
\cite{geim2007rise, nair2008fine}. Also graphene behaves like a metal
\cite{geim2007rise} but it presents a tunable band gap by changing the layer
area \cite{han2007energy}, aplying an electric field \cite{zhang2009direct},
and by dopping \cite{ohta2006controlling,
elias2009control,guisinger2009exposure,samarakoon2010tunable}. As shown in
Figure \ref{fig:structures} when a hydrogen is bonded to a carbon atom of the
graphene planar structure, it pulls the carbon atom from the plane modifying the 
carbon--carbon bond length and leading to the possibility of opening the gap
\cite{samarakoon2010tunable}. The {\altstc} and {\upstc} systems presented in 
this paper have those characteristics presenting a gap of energy.


In this paper, we are focused in the characterization of three phenomena of
interest, all of them recently studied on semiconducting bulk an surfaces
systems: the one-photon optical spin and current injection and  second
harmonic generation (SHG). First, the optical spin injection might be
characterized by the physical dimensionless quantity of degree of spin
polarization (DSP), in the \emph{i} direction ($D^{i}$), which is a function of
the photon frequency, $\omega$. The DSP gives a quantitative value of the
fraction of injected electrons from the valence to the conduction bands that
are spin polarized. There are theoretical reports of calculations for the spin
injection in bulk media  (Si, GaAs, CdSe, and Ge semiconductors)
\cite{nastos2007full,cabellos2009stress,rioux2010optical} and surfaces
[Si(111):In, Si(111):As, GaAs(110):Sb, GaAs(110), and Si(111) with $4\times2$
and $8\times2$ reconstructions]\cite{mendoza2012optical,arzate2014optical}.
Hereupon, the one-photon current injection is characterized by the current
injection tensor, $\eta(0;\omega,-\omega)$  being a particular case of the
current injection tensor $\eta(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2};\omega_{1},-\omega_{2})$,
where $\omega{1}$ and $\omega{2}$ are the frequencies of two different incident
beams. The frequency dependence of the injection current tensor is expressed as
$\eta(\omega)$ instead of $\eta(0;\omega,-\omega)$.

In the other hand, nonlinear optical spectroscopies, particularly SHG, are
important methods to study surfaces. The importance of this kind of tests come
from their noninvasive and nondestructive nature to study surfaces and
interfaces obtaining as result the atomic structure, phase transitions,
adsorption of atoms, and many other properties \cite{dadap1997second,
daum1993identification,mcgilp1994probing,power1995resonant,
godefroy1996electric,salazar2014molecular,chen1981surface,
mendoza1998microscopic}. For the calculation of the SHG we followed the new
formalism developed by Anderson \emph{et al.} for theoretical approach of
surface second-harmonic generation from semiconductor surfaces
\cite{anderson2015theory} based on the $\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{E} $ or
\textit{length gauge} and the electron density operator. This formalism can be
applied to surface and bulk structures \cite{anderson2015theory,sipe2000second}.

The organization of the sections of this paper is as follows. In Sec. \ref{sec:theory}
we present the theory that describes the phenomena of our interest: DSP and current injection, in a given
\emph{i} direction, ($D^{i}$ and $\eta^{ijk}$), and SHG. The calculations of them
are given in the independent-particle approximation. In Sec.
\ref{sec:results} we describe the details of the calculation for the responses
and the corresponding spectra for  $D^{i}$, $\eta^{ijk}$, and SHG for the
respective \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures. Finally, we give conclusions in
Sec. \ref{sec:conclusions}.

    \subsection{Optical spin injection}

The injection and detection of spin polarized electrons into nonmagnetic
materials is the core of spintronics \cite{vzutic2004spintronics,fert2008nobel,
pezzoli2012optical,bottegoni2013experimental,bottegoni2013photoinduced} and an
important problem in condensed matter. The process of optical spin injection of
carriers appears when circularly polarized light (CPL)
\cite{dyakonov1984theory} insides in a semiconductor media promoting spin
polarized electrons from the valence to the conduction bands. This process
takes place as a result of the interaction of electron spin and motion caused
by the spin-orbit coupling in media. The DSP gives a quantitative value of the
fraction of injected electrons into the conduction bands that are spin
polarized. It can be calculated by full band structure local-density
approximation (LDA) and $\textbf{k}\cdot \textbf{p}$ methods
\cite{nastos2007full,cabellos2009stress}.

Mendoza and Cabellos derived the expressions for the optical spin generation
appropriate for surfaces and interfaces \cite{mendoza2012optical}. They used a
slab approach in order to model the surface. They wrote the surface DSP along
direction \emph{i} as

\begin{equation}
    D^{i}(\omega) = \frac{-2i \zeta^{ixy} (\omega)}{\hbar \left[
    \xi^{xx}(\omega) + \xi^{yy}(\omega) \right] /2 } \label{eq:D^i}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\zeta^{ixy} (\omega)$ and $\xi^{aa}(\omega)$ are the surface
spin injection rate tensor components and the diagonal components of the
surface carrier generation rate tensor, respectively, and the indexes
\emph{i},\emph{j},\emph{k} denote Cartesian coordinates.

In our calculation we consider a normal incidence of CPL propagating along the
\emph{-z} direction,

\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{E} (\omega) = E_{0}(\hat{x} -i \hat{y})/\sqrt{2}, 
\end{equation*}


\noindent where $E_{0}$ is the field intensity. In a first approximations it is 
possible to generate spin-polarized electrons, from the valence to the
conduction bands, along the $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ directions with
incident light on the surface plane. The total DSP can be obtained by the
relation

\begin{equation*}
    |{D^{\text{T}}}| = \sqrt{ \left[ D^{x} \right]^{2} + \left[ D^{y}
    \right]^{2} + \left[ D^{z} \right]^{2} }
\end{equation*}

\noindent where the dependence in frequency, $\omega$, has been omitted.

    \subsection{Optical current injection}

The optical current injection (OCI) is a second-order nonlinear effect that
takes place in non-centrosymmetric structures \cite{nastos2006optical,
cabellos2011optical,bhat2005excitonic,fraser1999quantum}. The photocurrent can
be injected with a single optical beam and is produced by the interference of
one photon-absorption processes associated with different linear polarizations
of light \cite{sipe2000second}. Also called  \emph{circular photovoltaic
effect} the OCI occurs in a non-centrosymmetric media when it is photoexcited
with CPL, producing an interference effect in the excitation pathways, and
resulting in an asymmetric population of the injected carriers in reciprocal
space and, therefor, a photocurrent. This photocurrent phenomena has been
studied in bulk semiconductors, one dimensional (1D) nanotubes
\cite{mele2000coherent,kral2000photogalvanic}, and two dimensional (2D)
surfaces \cite{mele2000coherent}.

In the year 2011 Cabellos and Mendoza \emph{et al.} \cite{cabellos2011optical}
derived the expression for the generation of the injection current for surfaces
and interfaces. They defined the surface injection current as

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\dot{J}}^{i}_{\text{inj}}(\omega) =
    \eta^{ijk}(\omega)E_{j}(\omega)E_{k}(\omega), \label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\eta^{ijk}(\omega)$ is the surface injection current tensor.
Thus, according to Eq. \ref{eq:eta}, a photocurrent is optically injected in
the \emph{i} direction when two polarized electric fields, in the \emph{j} and
\emph{k} directions, inside over a surface. For a surface system we have that
{\ea} is given by \cite{cabellos2011optical, arzate2014optical}

\begin{equation}
    \eta^{ijk} (\omega) = \ell_{\text{eff}} \times \sum_{\ell=1}^{n_{eff}}
    \eta_{ijk} (\ell|\omega). \label{eq:etaeff}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the sum is made over the number of layers that contributes to
the response of the media, $\eta_{ijk} (\ell|\omega)$ corresponds to the
$\ell_{\text{th}}$-layer contribution to the surface injection current tensor
and $\ell_{\text{eff}}$ is the thickness to the total layers that contribute to
the response. The tensor $\eta^{ijk}(\omega)$ is purely imaginary and has the
property of being antisymmetric in the last two Cartesian indices, \emph{j} and
\emph{k} \cite{sipe2000second,nastos2006optical}.

Taking in account that with CPL is possible to generate current injection
along the $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ directions with incident light on
the surface plane, the total injection current can be obtained in a similar way
as has been done in Eq. \ref{eq:D^i}

\begin{equation*}
    |{\eta^{\text{T}}}| = \sqrt{ \left[ \eta^{xxy} \right]^{2} + \left[
    \eta^{yxy} \right]^{2} + \left[ \eta^{zxy} \right]^{2} }
\end{equation*}

\noindent where the dependence in frequency, $\omega$, has been omitted again.

The units of both $\mathbf{\dot{J}}^{i}_{\text{inj}}(\omega)$ and $\eta^{ijk}
(\omega)$  are those of their bulk equivalents times $\ell_{\text{eff}}$
expressed in the corresponding units to report \cite{cabellos2011optical}.



    \subsection{Second harmonic generation}

SHG, also called frequency doubling, is a particular case of the nonlinear
optical process of sum of frequency in which photons of same frequency are
annihilated to produce a new photon with twice frequency and energy and half of
wavelength of the initial photons. This phenomena occurs when light beams from
coherent sources inside over a nonlinear media that does not present inversion
of symmetry \cite{bloembergen1962light,anderson2015theory,salazar2014molecular,
sipe2000second}.

Recently, Anderson \emph{et al.} \cite{anderson2015theory} developed a new
formalism to calculate the second order susceptibility which includes the
scissors correction, needed to have the correct value of the energy band gap;
the contribution of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, frequently used
in \emph{ab initio} band-structure calculations; and the derivation for the inclusion
of the cut function, used to extract the surface response. According to that we
have the expressions for the imaginary part of the interband contributions
(\emph{i}) and intraband (\emph{e}) for $1\omega$ and $2\omega$

\begin{subequations}\label{eq:chis}
    \begin{equation}
        \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,\omega}]= 
        \frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}
        \int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
        \sum_{vc}\sum_{q\neq(v,c)}\frac{1}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
        \left[
        \frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{qc}\{r^{\mathrm{b}}_
        {cv}r^{\mathrm{c}}_{vq}\}]} {(2\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega^\Sigma_{cq})} 
        -\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vq}\{r^{\mathrm{c}}
        _{qc}r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}\}]} {(2\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega^\Sigma_{qv})}
        \right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
    \end{equation}  
    \begin{equation}
        \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{i,\omega}]= 
        \frac{\pi\vert e\vert^3}{2\hbar^2}
        \int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
        \sum_{cv}\frac{1}{(\omega^\Sigma_{cv})^{2}}
        \left[
        \mathrm{Re}\left[\left\{r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}\left(\mathcal{V}^
        {\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\right)_{;k^{\mathrm{c}}}\right\}\right]
        +\frac{\mathrm{Re}\left[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\left\{
        r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}
        \Delta^{\mathrm{c}}_{cv}\right\}\right]}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}} 
        \right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,2\omega}]= 
        -\frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}
        \int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
        \sum_{vc}\frac{4}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
        \left[
        \sum_{v'\ne
          v}\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\{r^{\mathrm{
        b}}_{cv'}r^{\mathrm{c}}_{v'v}\}]}
        {2\omega^\Sigma_{cv'}-\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
        - \sum_{c'\ne
          c}\frac{\mathrm{Im}[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\{r^
          {\mathrm{c}}_{cc'}r^{\mathrm{b}}_{c'v}\}]}
        {2\omega^\Sigma_{c'v}-\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}
        \right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-2\omega),
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{i,2\omega}]= 
         \frac{\pi \vert
           e\vert^{3}}{2\hbar^2}
        \int \frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}
        \sum_{vc}\frac{4}{(\omega^\Sigma_{cv})^{2}}
        \left[\mathrm{Re}\left[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\left\{
        \left(r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}\right)_{;k^{\mathrm{c}}}
        \right\}\right] -
        \frac{2\mathrm{Re}\left[\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma,\mathrm{a}}_{vc}\left\{
        r^{\mathrm{b}}_{cv}
        \Delta^{\mathrm{c}}_{cv}\right\}\right]}{\omega^\Sigma_{cv}}\right]
        \delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-2\omega)
        .
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Here, the factor of 2 for spin degeneracy is not included and the
real part of each contribution can be obtained through a Kramers-Kronig
transformation \cite{tancogne2014effect} and

\begin{equation}\label{eq:chitotal}
    \chi^{abc} = \chi^{abc}_{e,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{e,2\omega} +
    \chi^{abc}_{i,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{i,2\omega}
    .
\end{equation}

As made before, in Eq. \ref{eq:chis} and \ref{eq:chitotal} the dependence in
frequency, $\omega$, has been omitted. For our case in Eq. \ref{eq:chis}, the
expression $\mathcal{V}^{\Sigma}$ corresponds to the sum of the LDA and 
non-local velocity matrix elements, $r^{\mathrm{a}} $ are the position matrix
elements and $\Delta^{a}_{nm} = v^{\text{LDA},a}_{nn} - v^{\text{LDA},a}_{mm}
$. To accomplish the required intrinsic permutation symmetry, the \{\} notation
symmetrizes the $bc$ Cartesian indices, i.e., $\{u^{b}s^{c}\} = (u^{b}s^{c} +
u^{c}s^{b})/{2}$ and so, $\chi^{abc} = \chi^{acb}$. The units of $\chi^{ijk} $,
again, are those of their bulk equivalents times $\ell_{\text{eff}}$ expressed
in the corresponding units to report. For full details read the appendix of
Ref. \cite{anderson2015theory}.

\section{Results} % (fold)
\label{sec:results}

We present the results of the numerical calculations for {\di}, {\ea}, and SHG for
the hydrogenated graphene structures, {\altstc} and {\upstc} shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:structures}. Both systems are infinite carbon planes in an
hexagonal honeycomb lattice with 50\% of hydrogenation in two different
arrangements: the \emph{alt} arrangement [Fig \ref{fig:altstruct}] has
alternating hydrogen bonds in the top and bottom sides of the carbon plane; the
\emph{up} arrangement [Fig \ref{fig:upstruct}] has hydrogen bonds only in the top
side. Both structures are non-centrosymmetric and has a thickness of 5.56 and
2.76 Angstroms, respectively. A vacuum length at least  five times the
thickness of each case was taken to construct the super-cell.


In this work we used the ABINIT code \cite{torrent2008implementation} for the
calculation of the self-consistent ground state and their Kohn-Sham states
using DFT-LDA in the plane waves approximation. Also, to compute the DSP
and the OCI we used the relativistic separable dual-space Gaussian
pseudopotentials of Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH)
\cite{hartwigsen1998relativistic} including the spin-orbit interaction,
necessary to make the calculations of $D^{i} $ but not in the cases of {\ea}.
For the caso of SHG we used Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials
\cite{troullier1991efficient} that are fully separable nonlocal
pseudopotentials in the Kleiman-Bylander form \cite{kleinman1982efficacious}.
The contribution of the non-local potential in Eq. \ref{eq:chis} is carried out
using the DP code \cite{olevanoDP}. Moreover, we have taken a cutoff energy of
65 and 40\,Ha for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively, and
the energy eigenvalues and matrix elements were calculated using 14452 and 8452
\textbf{k}\,points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ).

In Figs. \ref{fig:alt-Da} and \ref{fig:up-Da} we show the spectra obtained for
{\di} of the {\altstc} and {\upstc} structures, respectively. Values over
(under) zero define a positive (negative) direction of spin polarization along
the \emph{i} direction. It can be observed that for both structures we have
more than 40\% of {\di} and a maximum absolute value in the \emph{y} direction,
reaching almost a 70\% for the \emph{alt} case. In table \ref{tab:dacomp}
we show a comparison of the maximum degree of spin polarization reported for
different structures.

To report the {\ea} we took in account that our structures are infinite 
carbon-hydrogen layers. So in Eq. \ref{eq:etaeff} we defined the 
$\ell_{\text{eff}}$
as the thickness of each structure, corresponding to 5.56 and 2.76 Angstroms for 
the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. We show in Figs. 
\ref{fig:alt-eta} and
\ref{fig:up-eta}  the spectra obtained for the current tensor {\ea} of the
\emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems, respectively. We can observe that
circularly polarized light (CPL) on the plane $xy$ produces injection current
along three directions. Values over (under) zero define a positive (negative)
direction of current injection along the \emph{i} direction. From Fig.
\ref{fig:eta} we can see that for the \emph{alt} system spectra [Fig.
\ref{fig:alt-eta}] we have a positive maximum in the \emph{y} direction for an
incident beam energy of 1.25\,eV, reaching a value of
3.7\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. Also, for the \emph{up} spectra [Fig.
\ref{fig:up-eta}] we have a positive maximum in the \emph{y} direction for an
incident beam energy of 0.09\,eV, reaching a value of
28\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. In table \ref{tab:etacomp} we present a comparison
of the maximum current injection reported for different structures.

In Figs. \ref{fig:shg-alt} and \ref{fig:shg-up} we show the spectra obtained
for the SHG for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems, respectively. The
Figs. \ref{fig:alt-shg-re} and \ref{fig:up-shg-re} show the real part of the
non-zero components, Figs. \ref{fig:alt-shg-im} and \ref{fig:up-shg-im} the
imaginary part, and Figs. \ref{fig:alt-shg-abs} and \ref{fig:alt-shg-abs} the
absolute value of the $\chi^{ijk}(2\omega;\omega\omega) $ tensor. We can see
from Fig. \ref{fig:shg-alt} that for the \emph{alt} structure an absolute
maximum of the SHG spectra is reached at 0.4\,eV with a value of
0.6$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V for the $\chi^{yxx} $ component produced
principally for contributions of the imaginary part. Also, a second local
maximum is reached at 1.1\,eV with a value of 0.55$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V
for the $\chi^{xxx} $ component having in this case a principal contribution
from the real part. In the other hand, from Fig. \ref{fig:shg-up} we can see that for the
\emph{up} structure the absolute maximum is found near to 0.042\,eV reaching a
value of 70$\times10^{6} $\,pm$^{2}$/V for the $\chi^{yxx} $ tensor component
which contribution comes from the imaginary part of the spectra. In table
\ref{tab:shgcomp} we show a comparison of the maximum SHG reported for
different structures.

\section{Conclusions} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have performed an \emph{ab initio} calculation for the spin and current injection and
Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) on the hydrogenated graphene {\altstc} and
{\upstc} structures [Figs. \ref{fig:altstruct} and \ref{fig:upstruct}] with the
independent particle approximation (IPA). Our calculations predicts that it is
possible to inject spin-polarized electrons along the perpendicular direction
to the surface plane, obtaining a degree of spin polarization (DSP) of the
injected electrons about 48\% and 68\%  (Fig. \ref{fig:Da}) at the photon energies of around 0.719
and 0.08\,Ha  for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. This results predicts that particularly
the \emph{up} structure is usable for spintronics proposes. Also, our results
about the optical current injection (OCI) with circularly polarized light (CPL)
show that the \emph{alt}  and \emph{up} systems have a response near to 3.70
and 28.0\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:eta}) for incident beams with energies of around
1.25 and 0.09\,eV. According to measurements already done on bulk materials, it
is actually possible to measure such amount of injection current density. Thus 
the control of the motion of the electron at the
{\altstc} and {\upstc} structures is possible by incidence of circularly
polarized light. Finally we found that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures
present a absolute maximum of 0.6$\times 10^{6}$ and 70.0\,$\times 10^{6}
$\,pm$^{2}$/V (Figs. \ref{fig:shg-alt} and \ref{fig:shg-up}) at the photon energies of around 0.40 and 0.042\,eV.
According to these results we can say that the systems of study in this paper are
usable to SHG.
