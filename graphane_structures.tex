We present a theoretical study of spin and current injection, and 
second-harmonic generation via optical means from the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up graphene structures. The incidence of circularly polarized
light onto nonmagnetic semiconductors produces spin-polarized electrons in the
conduction bands. Current injection and second-harmonic generation are
nonlinear, second-order effects that can be produced from both the bulk and
surface of non-centrosymmetric materials. In centrosymmetric materials, these
effects can only be observed at the surface where the inversion symmetry is
broken.} {We also report results for the degree of spin polarization, current
injection, and second-harmonic generation calculated within a full electronic
band structure scheme at the DFT-LDA level using a planewave basis. Our
results show that these effects can be optically generated in both the
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures, presenting an
anisotropic behavior. We obtain a maximum degree of spin polarization of 39\%
for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt, and 57\% for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up, which are
promising results for potential applications in spintronics.}}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Graphene is an allotrope of carbon with a planar, hexagonal, two-dimensional
honeycomb structure with one carbon atom at each vertex \cite{geim2007rise}.
It has attracted great interest due to its distinctive physical properties,
such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, optical absorption, thermal
conductivity, and band structure \cite{geim2007rise,nair2008fine}. Producing
high-quality, monolayer sheets of graphene is typically a difficult and costly
process. The two most popular methods are graphite exfoliation, and epitaxial
growth on crystalline surfaces. The tremendous availability of graphite
(pencil lead) has allowed the first method to blossom into an entire field of
study \cite{novoselovPNAS05,chungJES00,choiCC10,caiJMC12,hernandezNN08}.
Despite these difficulties, the potential applications of this material have
turned it into an extremely rich field of study.

Graphene has been characterized by a variety of microscopic and mechanical
techniques such as atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
scanning tunneling microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy
\cite{geim2007rise,rao2009graphene,boehm1994nomenclature,novoselov2005two}.
Graphene normally behaves like a metal \cite{geim2007rise}, but possesses a
band gap that can be tuned by a change the total area \cite{han2007energy},
application of an electric field \cite{zhang2009direct}, or by doping 
\cite{ohta2006controlling,elias2009control,guisinger2009exposure,%
samarakoon2010tunable}.

In this paper we present a study on two hydrogenated graphene structures,
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up. We can obtain different spatial
configurations by varying the amount and location of the hydrogen doping. Both
of these cases have 50\% hydrogenation, and present a discernible band gap.As
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}, when a hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon
atom in the graphene plane, it pulls the carbon atom from the plane modifying
the carbon-carbon bond length, and possibly opening the band gap
\cite{samarakoon2010tunable}. The \emph{alt} case has hydrogen on both sides
of the sheet, alternating between the upper and lower faces of the plane. The
\emph{up} case has all the hydrogens on a single side, producing a zig-zag
form in the carbon lattice.

We focus this study on three optical phenomena primarily used for
characterizing semiconducting materials: the degree of spin polarization
(DSP), optical current injection (OCI), and second-harmonic generation (SHG).
We briefly describe these as follows.

The optical spin injection is characterized by the adimensional degree of spin polarization (DSP), which is a function of frequency. The DSP is the fraction of injected electrons in the conduction bands that are spin polarized versus those that are not. There are theoretical reports of DSP calculations for bulk media (Si, GaAs, CdSe, and Ge semiconductors) \cite{nastos2007full,cabellos2009stress,rioux2010optical} and surfaces [Si(111):In, Si(111):As, GaAs(110):Sb, GaAs(110), and Si(111) with $4\times2$ and $8\times2$ reconstructions] \cite{mendoza2012optical,arzate2014optical}.

The OCI is a surface-sensitive optical effect with potential application for surface characterization and chemical reaction control. It is a second-order nonlinear process that takes place in non-centrosymmetric materials \cite{nastos2006optical,cabellos2011optical,bhat2005excitonic,fraser1999quantum}. This photocurrent has been studied in bulk semiconductors \cite{atanasov1996coherent,sipe2000second}, one dimensional (1D) nanotubes \cite{mele2000coherent,kral2000photogalvanic}, and two dimensional (2D) surfaces \cite{mele2000coherent,cabellos2011optical}.

Nonlinear optical spectroscopies, particularly SHG, are important methods for styudying surface properties due to their noninvasive and nondestructive nature. These properties include atomic structure, phase transitions, adsorption of atoms, and many others \cite{dadap1997second,daum1993identification,mcgilp1994probing,power1995resonant,godefroy1996electric,salazar2014molecular,chen1981surface,mendoza1998microscopic}. SHG is a particular case of the nonlinear optical process of sum of frequency in which photons of same frequency are annihilated to produce a new photon with twice the frequency and energy and half of the wavelength of the initial photons. This phenomena occurs when light beams from coherent sources inside over a nonlinear media that does not present inversion of symmetry \cite{bloembergen1962light,andersonPRB15,sipe2000second}.

The organization of the sections of this paper is as follows. In Sec. \ref{sec:theory} we present the theory and formulas that describe the DSP, current injection, and SHG. In Sec. \ref{sec:results} we describe the details of the calculation and the corresponding spectra for the respective \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures. Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec. \ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

In this section we present the formulas used for calculating the DSP \cite{nastos2007full,mendoza2012optical}, OCI \cite{cabellos2011optical,sipe2000second}, and SHG \cite{andersonPRB15}. For a full derivations see the references for each.

\subsection{Optical spin injection}\label{sec:theory-DSP}

The injection and detection of spin polarized electrons into nonmagnetic
materials is the core of spintronics \cite{vzutic2004spintronics,%
fert2008nobel,pezzoli2012optical,bottegoni2013experimental,%
bottegoni2013photoinduced} and an important problem in condensed matter
theory. The process of optical spin injection appears when circularly
polarized light (CPL) \cite{dyakonov1984theory} is incident on a
semiconducting material. This allows spin polarized electrons to move from the
valence to the conduction bands. This process is the result of the interaction
between the electron spin and the motion caused by the spin-orbit coupling in
the material. The DSP is the percentage of injected spin polarized electrons
in the conduction bands. It can be calculated with full band structure local-
density approximation (LDA), and $\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ methods
\cite{nastos2007full,cabellos2009stress}.

The spin and carrier generation rate can be described by 

\begin{align*}
\dot{S}^{a}(\omega) &= \zeta^{abc}(\omega)E^{b}(-\omega)E^{c}(\omega), \nonumber \\ 
\dot{n}(\omega)     &= \xi^{bc}E^{b}(-\omega)E^{c}(\omega)
\end{align*}
where $\zeta^{abc}$ is the spin injection rate tensor and $\xi^{bc}$ is the carrier generation rate tensor. The spin injection rate tensor is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:zeta}
\zeta^{abc} &= \frac{i\pi e^{2}}{\hbar^{2}}\int\frac{d^{3}k}{8\pi^{3}}
\sum_{vcc'}^{\prime}\text{Im}\bigl[S^{a}_{c'c}(\textbf{k})
r^{b}_{vc'}(\textbf{k})r^{c}_{cv}(\textbf{k})\nonumber\\
&\qquad+S^{a}_{cc'}(\textbf{k})
r^{b}_{vc}(\textbf{k})r^{c}_{c'v}(\textbf{k})\bigr]
\delta(\omega_{cv}(\textbf{k})-\omega),
\end{align}
where $S^{n}$ and $r^{n}$ are the spin and position matrix elements. The carrier generation rate tensor is related to the linear optical response tensor by $\xi^{bc}$=Im$[(2/\hbar)\chi^{bc}]$ . The $abc$ superscripts denote the Cartesian coordinates and the expression of Eq. \eqref{eq:zeta} satisfies the $\zeta^{abc} = -\zeta^{acb}$ condition.

We assume an incoming beam of CPL at normal incidence that propogates along the $-z$ direction, $\mathbf{E}(\omega) = E_{0}(\omega)(\hat{x} - i\hat{y})/\sqrt{2}$. The DSP along a given $a$ direction is defined as $D^{a}=\dot{S}^{a}(\omega)/(\hbar/2)\dot{n}(\omega)$, which can be reduced to 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:D^i}
D^{a}(\omega) = 
\frac{-4i\zeta^{axy}(\omega)}
    {\hbar\left[\xi^{xx}(\omega) + \xi^{yy}(\omega)\right]}.
\end{equation}
It is possible to generate current injection along all three directions with
an incident CPL beam.


\subsection{Optical current injection}\label{sec:theory-OCI}

This current can be produced with a single optical beam of CPL via the interference of one photon-absorption processes from different linear polarizations of light \cite{sipe2000second}. The  OCI is defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\dot{J}}^{a}_{\text{inj}}(\omega) =
\eta^{abc}(\omega)E_{b}(\omega)E_{c}(\omega), \label{eq:eta}
\end{equation}
where $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is the surface injection current tensor and is given by
\begin{align*}
\eta(\omega) =  \frac{i\pi e^{3}}{\hbar^{2}}&\int\frac{d^{3}k}{8\pi^{3}}
\nonumber \\
\times &
\sum_{vc}\Delta^{a}_{cv}(\mathbf{k})\text{Im}\big[r^{b}_{cv}(\mathbf{k})
r^{c}_{cv}(\mathbf{k})\big]\delta(\omega_{cv}(\mathbf{k})-\omega).
\end{align*}
$r^{n}$ is the position matrix elements and 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta^{a}_{cv} = v^{a}_{cc}(\mathbf{k})-v^{a}_{vv}(\mathbf{k}),
\end{equation*}
where $v^{a}_{nn}(\mathbf{k})=p^{a}_{nn}(\mathbf{k})/m_{e}$ is the electron velocity for band $n$.

The tensor $\eta^{abc}(\omega)$ is purely imaginary and is antisymmetric with respect to the last two indices, \emph{b} and \emph{c} \cite{sipe2000second,nastos2006optical} and then $\eta^{abc}$=$-\eta^{acb}$. Like in optical spin injection, it is possible to generate current injection along all three directions with an incident CPL beam.


\subsection{Second-harmonic generation}\label{sec:theory-SHG}

We follow the derivation developed in reference \cite{andersonPRB15}. This new formalism to calculate the second order susceptibility includes the scissors correction, the contribution of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, and the cut function. 

The second order nonlinear polarization is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}(2\omega) = \chi^{abc}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)E^{b}(\omega)E^{c}(\omega)
\end{equation*}
where $\chi^{abc}$ is the nonlinear susceptibility tensor responsible for the SHG and satisfies the $\chi^{abc}$ = $\chi^{acb}$ condition. The superscripts $abc$ denote the Cartesian components.  

The expressions for the imaginary part of $\chi^{abc}$ for the interband (\emph{e}) and intraband (\emph{i}) contributions, at $1\omega$ and $2\omega$ are given by
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:chis}
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,\omega}] =  
\frac{\pi |e|^3}{2\hbar^2}\int 
&
\frac{dk^3}{8\pi^3}  
\nonumber \\
\times \sum_{vc}\sum_{q\neq(v,c)}

\right]\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
\end{align}

\begin{align}

\frac{\pi\vert e\vert^3}{2\hbar^2}

\Bigg]
\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-\omega),
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\mathrm{Im}[\chi^{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{c}}_{e,2\omega}]= -

\Bigg]
\delta(\omega^\Sigma_{cv}-2\omega),

.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
$\mathbf{v}^{\Sigma}_{nm}$ is the complete velocity matrix elements defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nonlocal}
\mathbf{v}^{\Sigma}=\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{nl}}+\mathbf{v}^{S},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{nl}}$ includes the nonlocal potential, and
$\mathbf{v}^{S}$ the scissors correction. Lastly, $r^{\mathrm{a}}_{nm}$ is the
position matrix elements, and
$\omega^\Sigma_{nm}$=$\omega^{\Sigma}_{n}$-$\omega^{\sigma}_{m}$.

The real part of each contribution can be obtained through a Kramers-Kronig
transformation \cite{tancogne2014effect} and
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:chitotal}
    \chi^{abc} = \chi^{abc}_{e,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{e,2\omega} +
    \chi^{abc}_{i,\omega} + \chi^{abc}_{i,2\omega}
    .
\end{equation*}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

We present the results of the numerical calculations for {$D^{a}$}, {$\eta^{axy}$}, and $\chi^{abc}$ for the C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures shown in Fig. \ref{fig:structures}. Both systems are infinite planes of carbons in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice with 50\% of hydrogenation in two different arrangements. The \emph{alt} arrangement has alternating hydrogen bonds in the upper and lower sides of the carbon plane, and the \emph{up} arrangement has them only on the upper side. Both structures are non-centrosymmetric and have a thickness of 2.96\,{\AA} and 1.46\,{\AA}, respectively. 

In this work we used the ABINIT code \cite{torrent2008implementation} for the calculation of the self-consistent ground state and the Kohn-Sham states using DFT-LDA with a planewave basis in the independent particle approximation. We used Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH) relativistic separable dual-space Gaussian pseudopotentials \cite{hartwigsen1998relativistic} that include spin-orbit interaction for calculating $D^{i}$ and {$\eta^{ixy}$}, although the latter can also be calculated with pseudopotentials that lack this interaction. For $\chi^{abc}$ we used Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials \cite{troullier1991efficient} that are fully separable nonlocal pseudopotentials in the Kleiman-Bylander form \cite{kleinman1982efficacious}. The contribution from the nonlocal part used in Eq. \eqref{eq:nonlocal} is carried out using the DP code \cite{olevanoDP}. We used cutoff energies of 65\,Ha and 40\,Ha for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. The energy eigenvalues and matrix elements were calculated using 14452 \textbf{k} for \emph{alt} and 8452 \textbf{k} points for \emph{up}, in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ).


\subsection{Optical spin injection}

In Fig. \ref{fig:Da} we show the $D^{i}$ spectra for C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up. Values over (under) zero define a positive (negative) direction of spin polarization along the \emph{i} direction. For both cases, the system response begins when the energy of the incoming light is larger than the gap energy. For \emph{alt} this occurs near 0.7185\,eV and for \emph{up} this occurs near 0.078\,eV. Both cases have at least one {$D^{a}$} with more than 30\% of DSP. For \emph{up} we have nearly 60\% DSP in the $z$ direction, and for \emph{alt} nearly 40\% DSP in the $x$ and $y$ directions. The \emph{alt} structure presents an energy range between 0.7185\,eV and 0.72\,eV where it is possible to have the maximum value for $D^{a}$ in all directions. After 0.72\,eV, the DSP declines for all three components. Likewise, the \emph{up} system presents maximum values between 0.078\,eV to 0.081\,eV, and after 0.081\,eV the DSP slowly vanishes. 

In Table \ref{tab:dacomp} we present a comparison of the absolute maximum values of $D^{a}$ for different materials and the corresponding direction and energy at which they are reached. From this table we have that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems have less DSP than the Si(111)-As 1$\times$1 and the the bulk CdSe system, but are comparable to the Si(111)-In 8$\times$2, bulk Si, and bulk GaAs systems. Si(111)-In 8$\times$2 and \emph{alt} both have maxima around 0.7\,eV, which is the near infrared range. Conversely, the maxima for Si(111)-As 1$\times$1, bulk Si, and bulk GaAs all occur in the optical energy range.

As mentioned previously, the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases both have much larger energy ranges for the maximum DSP values in all directions. This compares very favorably with the other systems, that have very narrow ranges over which the maximum DSP is achieved. The 0.7\,eV maxima for \emph{alt} makes it an interesting candidate for further study, as this energy is readily obtainable using modern laser systems.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Optical current injection}

Fig. \ref{fig:eta} depicts the spectra obtained for the current tensor components $\eta^{axy}$ from the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems in. As with DSP, the onset of the system response occurs when the incident light achieves an energy above the gap. For \emph{alt} this occurs near 0.7185\,eV and for \emph{up} this occurs near 0.078\,eV.

Values over (under) zero define a positive (negative) direction of the current injection along the \emph{a} direction. As was mentioned before in Sec. \ref{sec:theory-OCI} for this case of CPL the $\eta^{abc}$ has only non zero components when the last two indexes are $xy$. So we report the three components, $xxy$, $yxy$, and $zxy$ , corresponding to the three Cartesian components.

We see that for the \emph{alt} system we have a positive maximum in the \emph{y} direction at an energy of 1.25\,eV, reaching a value of 1.95\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. For \emph{up} we obtain the maximum in the \emph{y} direction at an energy of 0.09\,eV, with a value of 18\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$. The response goes to zero after 1.75\,eV and 0.2\,eV for \emph{alt} and \emph{up}, respectively.

In table \ref{tab:etacomp} we present a comparison of the absolute maximum values of $\eta^{abc}$ reported for different materials and the corresponding direction and enerby at which the maximum is reached. 

From the table we can see that, excluding the case of the bulk CdSd, \emph{alt} reaches a larger value for $\eta^{abc}$ than some of the systems and is in the same order of magnitude that the Si(111) 2$\times$1 system and almos for the same photon energy, 1.25\,eV, which is in the which is the near infrared range. 

\emph{up} structure has the same order of magnitude as the bulk CdSd both in this case for a lower energy of the incoming beam.\

In Fig. \ref{fig:shg-abs-both} we show the absolute value of the different
nonzero components of $\chi^{abc}$ for both cases. For \emph{alt}, we note
that all components except $xxy$ present two peaks at $\sim0.5$\,eV and
$\sim1.0$\,eV. The first peak is completely produced by $2\omega$ resonances,
while the second peak is produced by a mixture of both $1\omega$ and $2\omega$
resonances, with the latter dominating in most cases. The $xxy$ component has
a single broadened peak with a discernible feature near 0.5\,eV. That feature,
much like the other components, is produced by $2\omega$ resonances, while the
maxima is produced by a mixture of both frequencies.

For \emph{up} we see one predominant peak around 0.05\,eV, completely produced
by $2\omega$ transitions. The $xxy$ and $yxx$ components have an additional
feature close to 0.09\,eV dominated by $1\omega$ transitions.

All spectra featured here include the contribution from the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, as detailed in Sec. \ref{sec:theory-shg}.

In table \ref{tab:shgcomp} we show a comparison of the maximum SHG reported for different structures. From the table we can see that the \emph{alt} structure has the minimum absolute value of the SHG tensor while the \emph{up} has he biggest one. In both cases the energy of the incoming beam needed to produce SHG is smaller than for the other cases shown here.

\section{Conclusions} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have performed \emph{ab initio} calculations for the spin and current injection and
Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) on the hydrogenated graphene C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures (Fig. \ref{fig:structures}) with the
independent particle approximation (IPA). Our calculations predicts that it is
possible to inject spin-polarized electrons along the perpendicular direction
to the surface plane, obtaining a degree of spin polarization (DSP) of the
injected electrons about 39\% and 57\%  (Fig. \ref{fig:Da}) at the photon energies of around 0.719
and 0.08\,Ha  for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. Also there is a range of energy
in which this DSP can be held, from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV and from 0.078 to 0.081\,eV for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} cases, respectively. This results predicts that particularly the \emph{up} structure is usable for spintronics proposes.

Also, our results about the optical current injection (OCI) with circularly polarized light (CPL)
show that the \emph{alt}  and \emph{up} systems have a response near to 1.95
and 18.0\,mC$^{3}$/J$^{2}$s$^{2}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:eta}) for incident beams with energies of around
1.25 and 0.09\,eV. According to measurements already done on bulk materials, it
is actually possible to measure such amount of injection current density. The motion of the electrons at the
C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-alt and C$_{16}$H$_{8}$-up structures can be controlled by the incidence of circularly
polarized light. Finally we found that the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures
present a absolute maximum of 0.6$\times 10^{6}$ and 70.0\,$\times 10^{6}
$\,pm$^{2}$/V (Fig. \ref{fig:shg-abs-both}) at the photon energies of around 0.40 and 0.042\,eV for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems.
According to these results we can say that the \emph{up} system is usable for SHG.
