REVIEWER REPORT:
-------------------------------

Please note that reviewers may not be numbered consecutively.

Reviewer #1:

The authors report a concise report on their DFT calculations for the
nonlinear optical properties of 50% hydrogenated graphene structures. I am not
sure how relevant the results will be for practical applications, but they
will certainly be of interest for specialists working in this field.

The methodology is appropriate and well explained, and the results are
original and new.

The physics discussion would probably benefit if the nonlinear response
functions calculated were related to the electronic band structure of the
systems discussed. The authors refer to Ref. 11 for the band gap, but this
reference considers bilayer graphene.

============================================================================
Our reply:

Band structure analysis.

We replaced Ref. 11 with Ref. 9 and added Ref. 12, both of which concern the
hydrogenation of monolayer graphene and how the addition of Hydrogen
effectively 'opens' the band gap.
============================================================================

Also, there are quite a number of typos in the text:
- bot structures
- was show that
- the the total response
- in Fig. 4 presents
The text obviously needs a careful polishing.

============================================================================
Our reply:

The aforementioned typos have been corrected and the entire manuscript has
been suitably revised.
============================================================================

Once these issues are addressed, the paper will probably be suitable for
publication.


Reviewer #3: 

This paper by Zapata-Pena et al reports a theoretical investigation on
nolinear response in hydrogenated graphene architectures. This is professional
work. I think that it would be of interest to a wide audience of researchers
active in this important field.

My overall opinion on this work is positive. I have only one
comment/suggestion for the authors.

The authors rely on LDA calculations for their predictions. There is no
further examination of the method-sensitivity of the results. I would not
suggest Â that the authors perform additional calculations. A few sentences
would be enough to caution/enlighten the readers. See for instance recent work
on graphenes by Karamanis (J. Phys. Chem. C, 2015, 119 (21), pp 11872-11885)
and a recent review on the quantitative analysis of the predictive capability
of DFT methods, StructBonding 149, 95 (2012).

============================================================================
Our reply:

We added the following lines in the introductory part of the results:



============================================================================

Publication recommended after some minor revision/reshaping, as suggested
above.
